# Unused Files

This directory contains files that are not currently used in the application but are kept for
reference.

These files may be:
- Outdated JSX versions of components that have been converted to TypeScript
- Redundant components that have been replaced
- Components that reference functionality not yet implemented

If you need to use any of these files, consider converting them to TypeScript (.tsx) first.
