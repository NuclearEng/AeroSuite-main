## Task-to-Code Mapping

_This section will be populated with detailed task-to-code relationships._

### Example Task Mapping

#### TS001: Health check system implementation

__Status:__ âœ… Completed
__Priority:__ ðŸ”´ High
__Dependencies:__ None

##### Associated Files

| File Path | Type |

## Dependency Graph

_A visual representation of task dependencies will be generated here._

## How to Use This Report

1. __Find files related to a task__: Use the task-to-code mapping to find all files related to a 
specific task.
2. __Understand dependencies__: View the dependency graph to understand task relationships.
3. __Identify coverage gaps__: Check the task coverage section to identify areas with insufficient 
traceability.

## Maintaining Traceability

To improve task traceability:

1. Add task references to files using:
   ```
   node scripts/task-management/enhanced-task-reference.js
   ```

2. Always include task IDs in commit messages:
   ```
   git commit -m "[TS123] Implement feature X"
   ```

3. Run the visualization tool to update this report:
   ```
   node scripts/task-management/enhanced-task-reference.js --visualize-only
   ```
