### Compliance Readiness Plan

To improve compliance readiness:

1. Prioritize implementing missing controls for SOC 2 compliance
2. Document security policies and procedures
3. Implement regular security testing and validation
4. Set up ongoing compliance monitoring

## Next Steps

1. Run `node scripts/task-management/task-creator.js` to create tasks for missing security controls
2. Update existing security tasks with verification methods
3. Schedule regular compliance reviews
