# Security Headers Implementation

This document provides an overview of the security headers implemented in the AeroSuite application to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

## Overview

Security headers are HTTP response headers that, when set, can enhance the security of web applications by enabling browser security features and mitigating common web vulnerabilities. The AeroSuite application implements a comprehensive set of security headers to protect against various attacks.

## Implemented Security Headers

### Content Security Policy (CSP)

Content Security Policy is a defense-in-depth mechanism that helps prevent various types of attacks, including Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.

```
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' https://cdn.aerosuite.com; ...
```

Our CSP implementation:
- Restricts loading resources to trusted sources only
- Prevents inline scripts and styles in production
- Allows websocket connections for real-time features
- Configures different policies for development and production environments

### HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

HSTS ensures that browsers only connect to the application over HTTPS, preventing protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking.

```
Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=15552000; includeSubDomains; preload
```

Our HSTS implementation:
- Sets a long max-age (180 days)
- Includes subdomains for complete protection
- Uses the preload directive for browser preloading lists

### X-Content-Type-Options

This header prevents browsers from MIME-sniffing a response away from the declared content type, reducing the risk of drive-by downloads and MIME confusion attacks.

```
X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
```

### X-Frame-Options

This header protects against clickjacking attacks by preventing the page from being embedded in frames.

```
X-Frame-Options: DENY
```

### X-XSS-Protection

This header enables the browser's built-in XSS filtering capabilities.

```
X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
```

### Referrer-Policy

This header controls how much referrer information should be included with requests.

```
Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
```

### Permissions-Policy

This header (formerly Feature-Policy) allows control over browser features and APIs.

```
Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=(self), interest-cohort=()
```

## CORS Configuration

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is a security feature implemented by browsers that restricts web pages from making requests to a different domain than the one that served the original page.

Our CORS implementation:
- Restricts access to trusted origins only
- Configures appropriate methods and headers
- Implements proper preflight handling
- Logs security events for blocked CORS requests

## Implementation Details

The security headers are implemented using:
1. A dedicated middleware module for security headers (`security-headers.middleware.js`)
2. A dedicated middleware module for CORS configuration (`cors.middleware.js`)
3. The Helmet.js library for most security headers
4. Custom middleware for headers not covered by Helmet

## Configuration

Security headers can be configured through environment variables and the application config:

- `NODE_ENV`: Determines whether to use development or production settings
- `CSP_REPORT_ONLY`: When set to 'true', CSP runs in report-only mode
- `TRUSTED_ORIGINS`: Comma-separated list of trusted origins for CORS

## Testing and Verification

To verify the security headers implementation:

1. Use browser developer tools to inspect response headers
2. Run the security headers verification script: `npm run verify-security-headers`
3. Use online tools like [securityheaders.com](https://securityheaders.com) to scan the application
4. Use the Mozilla Observatory: [observatory.mozilla.org](https://observatory.mozilla.org/)

## Best Practices

1. Regularly review and update security headers
2. Test security headers in a staging environment before deploying to production
3. Monitor CSP violation reports to identify potential issues
4. Keep the Helmet.js library updated to the latest version
5. Follow the principle of least privilege when configuring CSP directives
