# Data Protection System

This document provides an overview of the comprehensive data protection system implemented in
AeroSuite to protect sensitive data.

## Overview

AeroSuite implements a multi-layered data protection system that includes:

1. __Encryption at Rest__: Sensitive data is encrypted before being stored in the database.
2. __Secure Data Deletion__: Sensitive data can be securely deleted or anonymized when no longer
needed.
3. __Data Anonymization__: Data can be anonymized for analytics and reporting purposes.

## Architecture

The data protection system consists of the following components:

1. __Encryption Core__: A low-level encryption service that provides cryptographic operations.
2. __Data Protection Service__: A high-level service that orchestrates data protection operations.
3. __Mongoose Encryption Plugin__: A plugin that automatically encrypts/decrypts specified fields
in Mongoose models.
4. __API Endpoints__: RESTful endpoints for data protection operations.

## Sensitive Data Identification

The following data types are considered sensitive and are protected:

1. __Personal Identifiable Information (PII)__
   - Email addresses
   - Phone numbers
   - Physical addresses
   - Government IDs
   - Date of birth

2. __Authentication Data__
   - Password reset tokens
   - Two-factor authentication secrets
   - Recovery keys

3. __Financial Information__
   - Bank account numbers
   - Routing numbers
   - Payment information

4. __Business-Sensitive Information__
   - Contract terms
   - Private notes
   - Inspection comments

## Encryption Implementation

### Field-Level Encryption

AeroSuite uses field-level encryption to protect sensitive data while maintaining database
functionality:

```javascript
// Example of applying encryption to a schema
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  email: String,
  phoneNumber: String,
  personalDetails: {
    address: String,
    dateOfBirth: Date,
    governmentId: String
  }
});

// Apply encryption plugin
dataProtectionService.applyEncryptionToSchema(userSchema, 'User');
```bash

### Encryption Algorithm

- __Algorithm__: AES-256-GCM (Advanced Encryption Standard with 256-bit key length in
Galois/Counter Mode)
- __Key Management__: Hierarchical key management with master key and data encryption keys
- __Key Rotation__: Keys can be rotated periodically to maintain security

## Secure Data Deletion

AeroSuite supports two methods of data deletion:

1. __Soft Delete__: Sensitive fields are nullified, and the document is marked as deleted.
2. __Hard Delete__: The entire document is removed from the database.

```javascript
// Example of secure deletion
await dataProtectionService.securelyDeleteDocument(User, userId, {
  softDelete: true,
  auditTrail: true
});
```bash

## Data Anonymization

Data can be anonymized for analytics and reporting purposes:

```javascript
// Example of data anonymization
const anonymizedData = dataProtectionService.prepareDataForAnalytics(users, 'User');
```bash

### Anonymization Rules

Different anonymization strategies are applied based on the field type:

1. __Identifiers (emails, IDs)__: Hashed to maintain referential integrity
2. __Contact Information__: Completely redacted
3. __Dates__: Reduced to year only
4. __Addresses__: Reduced to country/state only
5. __Financial Information__: Completely removed

## API Endpoints

The data protection system exposes the following API endpoints:

| Endpoint | Method | Description | Required Role |
|----------|--------|-------------|--------------|
| `/api/v1/data-protection/status` | GET | Get data protection service status | ADMIN,
SECURITY_OFFICER |
| `/api/v1/data-protection/rotate-keys/:modelName` | POST | Rotate encryption keys for a model |
ADMIN, SECURITY_OFFICER |
| `/api/v1/data-protection/:modelName/:id` | DELETE | Securely delete a document | ADMIN,
SECURITY_OFFICER |
| `/api/v1/data-protection/anonymize/:modelName` | POST | Anonymize data for analytics | ADMIN,
SECURITY_OFFICER, DATA_ANALYST |
| `/api/v1/data-protection/apply-encryption/:modelName` | POST | Apply encryption to model | ADMIN,
SECURITY_OFFICER |

## Security Considerations

1. __Key Management__:
   - Master keys should be stored in a secure key management system
   - Key rotation should be performed regularly

2. __Access Control__:
   - Data protection operations are restricted to authorized roles
   - All operations are logged for audit purposes

3. __Compliance__:
   - This implementation helps meet requirements for GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and other regulations
   - Data minimization principles are enforced through anonymization

## Usage Examples

### Encrypting Sensitive Fields

```javascript
// In model definition
const supplierSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  name: String,
  contactDetails: {
    email: String,
    phoneNumber: String,
    address: String
  },
  bankingDetails: {
    accountNumber: String,
    routingNumber: String
  }
});

// Apply encryption
dataProtectionService.applyEncryptionToSchema(supplierSchema, 'Supplier');
```bash

### Anonymizing Data for Analytics

```javascript
// Get anonymized data for reports
const suppliers = await Supplier.find({});
const anonymizedSuppliers = dataProtectionService.prepareDataForAnalytics(suppliers, 'Supplier');

// Use anonymized data for analytics
generateSupplierReport(anonymizedSuppliers);
```bash

### Rotating Encryption Keys

```javascript
// Generate new key and re-encrypt all documents
await dataProtectionService.rotateEncryptionKeys(Supplier);
```bash

## Monitoring and Auditing

All data protection operations are logged to the security event system:

```javascript
logSecurityEvent(
  'DATA_PROTECTION',
  SEC_EVENT_SEVERITY.INFO,
  'Encryption keys rotated for Supplier',
  {
    component: 'DataProtectionService',
    action: 'ROTATE_KEYS',
    modelName: 'Supplier'
  }
);
```bash

These logs can be reviewed in the security event management system to ensure compliance and detect
potential security issues.
