## Recovery Team

### Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibilities | Contact Information |
|------|------------------|---------------------|
| Disaster Recovery Coordinator | Overall coordination of recovery efforts | coordinator@aerosuite.com |
| Database Administrator | Database backup and recovery | dba@aerosuite.com |
| Systems Administrator | Server and infrastructure recovery | sysadmin@aerosuite.com |
| Application Developer | Application restoration and verification | developer@aerosuite.com |
| Communications Officer | Stakeholder notifications | communications@aerosuite.com |
| Security Officer | Security verification during recovery | security@aerosuite.com |

### Activation Process

1. **Incident Detection**: System monitoring alerts or manual reporting identifies a potential disaster
2. **Assessment**: Recovery Coordinator evaluates the situation with technical team members
3. **Plan Activation**: If thresholds are met, the recovery plan is formally activated
4. **Team Notification**: All recovery team members are notified via multiple channels (email, phone, SMS)
5. **Command Center Setup**: Virtual or physical command center is established

## Critical Systems

### Priority 1 (Must recover within 4 hours)
- Authentication services
- Core database services
- Primary application servers

### Priority 2 (Must recover within 12 hours)
- Document storage and management
- Reporting services
- Email notification system

### Priority 3 (Must recover within 24 hours)
- Analytics and dashboard services
- Integration with third-party systems
- Historical data archives

## Backup Procedures

### Database Backups

- **Full Backups**: Daily at 01:00 UTC
- **Incremental Backups**: Hourly
- **Transaction Log Backups**: Every 15 minutes
- **Retention Policy**: 30 days for daily backups, 7 days for hourly backups
- **Storage Locations**: Primary cloud storage with geographic redundancy

```bash
# MongoDB backup script example
mongodump --host <db-host> --port <db-port> \
  --username <username> --password <password> \
  --db aerosuite --out /backup/mongo/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```

### File Backups

- **Document Storage**: Real-time replication to redundant storage
- **System Configuration**: Daily backups
- **Encryption**: All backups are encrypted at rest
- **Verification**: Automated backup verification runs daily

### Infrastructure as Code

- Infrastructure configuration is maintained in Terraform/CloudFormation templates
- CI/CD pipeline configurations are backed up daily
- Container definitions and orchestration configurations are version-controlled

## Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery

1. **Assessment**: Determine the extent of data loss and most recent valid backup
2. **Environment Preparation**: Provision recovery database instance
3. **Restoration**: Restore from the most recent valid backup
4. **Validation**: Verify data integrity and consistency
5. **Replication**: Re-establish replication if applicable
6. **Connection Reconfiguration**: Update application connection strings

```bash
# MongoDB restore example
mongorestore --host <recovery-host> --port <recovery-port> \
  --username <username> --password <password> \
  --db aerosuite /backup/mongo/<backup-date>
```

### Application Server Recovery

1. **Infrastructure Provisioning**: Deploy new application servers using IaC templates
2. **Configuration**: Apply system configuration from backups
3. **Application Deployment**: Deploy application code from artifact repository
4. **Service Verification**: Start services and verify functionality
5. **Load Balancer Configuration**: Update routing to new application servers

### File Storage Recovery

1. **Storage Provisioning**: Provision new storage resources
2. **Data Restoration**: Restore file data from backups
3. **Permission Configuration**: Apply security and access permissions
4. **Connectivity Verification**: Ensure application can access restored files

### Network Recovery

1. **Network Infrastructure**: Recover or failover to backup network components
2. **Security Configuration**: Reapply firewall rules and security groups
3. **DNS Updates**: Update DNS entries to point to recovered services
4. **SSL/TLS**: Ensure certificates are properly installed on recovered systems
