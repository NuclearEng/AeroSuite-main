### Activation Process

1. __Incident Detection__: System monitoring alerts or manual reporting identifies a potential 
disaster
2. __Assessment__: Recovery Coordinator evaluates the situation with technical team members
3. __Plan Activation__: If thresholds are met, the recovery plan is formally activated
4. __Team Notification__: All recovery team members are notified via multiple channels (email, 
phone, SMS)
5. __Command Center Setup__: Virtual or physical command center is established

## Critical Systems

### Priority 1 (Must recover within 4 hours)

- Core database services
- Primary application servers

### Priority 2 (Must recover within 12 hours)
- Document storage and management
- Reporting services
- Email notification system

### Priority 3 (Must recover within 24 hours)
- Analytics and dashboard services
- Integration with third-party systems
- Historical data archives

## Backup Procedures

### Database Backups

- __Full Backups__: Daily at 01:00 UTC
- __Incremental Backups__: Hourly
- __Transaction Log Backups__: Every 15 minutes
- __Retention Policy__: 30 days for daily backups, 7 days for hourly backups
- __Storage Locations__: Primary cloud storage with geographic redundancy

```bash
# MongoDB backup script example
mongodump --host <db-host> --port <db-port> \
  --username <username> --password <password> \
  --db aerosuite --out /backup/mongo/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)
```bash

### File Backups

- __Document Storage__: Real-time replication to redundant storage
- __System Configuration__: Daily backups
- __Encryption__: All backups are encrypted at rest
- __Verification__: Automated backup verification runs daily

### Infrastructure as Code

- Infrastructure configuration is maintained in Terraform/CloudFormation templates
- CI/CD pipeline configurations are backed up daily
- Container definitions and orchestration configurations are version-controlled

## Recovery Procedures

### Database Recovery

1. __Assessment__: Determine the extent of data loss and most recent valid backup
2. __Environment Preparation__: Provision recovery database instance
3. __Restoration__: Restore from the most recent valid backup
4. __Validation__: Verify data integrity and consistency
5. __Replication__: Re-establish replication if applicable
6. __Connection Reconfiguration__: Update application connection strings

```bash
# MongoDB restore example
mongorestore --host <recovery-host> --port <recovery-port> \
  --username <username> --password <password> \
  --db aerosuite /backup/mongo/<backup-date>
```bash

### Application Server Recovery

1. __Infrastructure Provisioning__: Deploy new application servers using IaC templates
2. __Configuration__: Apply system configuration from backups
3. __Application Deployment__: Deploy application code from artifact repository
4. __Service Verification__: Start services and verify functionality
5. __Load Balancer Configuration__: Update routing to new application servers

### File Storage Recovery

1. __Storage Provisioning__: Provision new storage resources
2. __Data Restoration__: Restore file data from backups
3. __Permission Configuration__: Apply security and access permissions
4. __Connectivity Verification__: Ensure application can access restored files

### Network Recovery

1. __Network Infrastructure__: Recover or failover to backup network components
2. __Security Configuration__: Reapply firewall rules and security groups
3. __DNS Updates__: Update DNS entries to point to recovered services
4. __SSL/TLS__: Ensure certificates are properly installed on recovered systems
