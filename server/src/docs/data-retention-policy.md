## Data Minimization

AeroSuite follows data minimization principles:

1. We collect only the data necessary for the specific purpose
2. We limit access to personal data to authorized personnel only
3. We anonymize or pseudonymize data where possible
4. We delete data when it's no longer needed for its original purpose

## Data Archiving

1. After the active period but before deletion, data may be archived in a secure, read-only format
2. Archived data is stored with enhanced security controls
3. Access to archived data requires additional authorization
4. Archived data remains subject to data subject rights

## Deletion Procedures

### Automated Deletion

The system automatically flags data for deletion when:
- The retention period expires
- A user account is deleted
- A customer or supplier relationship is terminated

### Manual Deletion

The following procedures apply for manual deletion:
1. Authorized administrators may initiate deletion
2. A two-step verification process confirms deletion requests
3. Deletion actions are logged in the audit system
4. Confirmation is provided when deletion is complete

### Deletion Methods

When data is deleted, the following methods are used:
1. Soft deletion: Data is marked as deleted but remains in the database for a specified grace period
2. Hard deletion: Data is permanently removed from the active database
3. Secure erasure: Backups and archives are periodically purged of deleted data

## Data Subject Rights

AeroSuite respects the following data subject rights:

1. **Right to Erasure**: Users can request deletion of their personal data
2. **Right to Restriction**: Users can request limitation of processing their data
3. **Right to Object**: Users can object to processing based on legitimate interests
4. **Right to Data Portability**: Users can request their data in a structured format

## Legal Holds

In the event of litigation, investigation, or audit:

1. Normal retention and deletion procedures may be suspended
2. Relevant data will be preserved until the legal hold is lifted
3. Only authorized legal and compliance personnel can initiate or remove legal holds

## Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy may be granted:

1. When required by law or regulation
2. When necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims
3. With explicit approval from the Data Protection Officer
