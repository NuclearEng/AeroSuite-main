# Redis Caching for Frequently Accessed Data

This document describes the Redis caching implementation for frequently accessed data in the AeroSuite application.

## Overview

Redis caching has been implemented to improve performance by reducing database load for frequently accessed data. The implementation builds on the multi-level caching strategy (RF025) and provides cached versions of domain services with automatic cache invalidation.

## Architecture

The Redis caching implementation consists of the following components:

1. **CachedService**: Base class for cached service implementations
2. **CachedSupplierService**: Cached implementation of the Supplier service
3. **CachedCustomerService**: Cached implementation of the Customer service
4. **ServiceFactory**: Factory for creating cached service instances

## How It Works

### Cached Service Base Class

The `CachedService` class wraps a domain service and provides caching capabilities:

- Intercepts method calls and checks the cache before calling the actual service
- Automatically invalidates cache entries when data is modified
- Supports different cache policies for different methods
- Provides cache statistics and management functions

### Service-Specific Implementations

Service-specific implementations (e.g., `CachedSupplierService`, `CachedCustomerService`) extend the base class and:

- Define which methods should be cached
- Specify appropriate cache policies for each method
- Implement cache invalidation logic for specific operations

### Service Factory

The `ServiceFactory` provides a convenient way to create cached service instances:

- Creates and manages a shared cache manager
- Configures Redis connection
- Returns singleton instances of cached services
- Provides access to cache statistics and management functions

## Cache Policies

Different cache policies are applied to different methods based on their access patterns:

- **findById**: Uses DYNAMIC policy (5-minute TTL with background refresh)
- **findAll**: Uses a custom policy (1-minute TTL with stale-while-revalidate)
- **search**: Uses MICRO policy (10-second TTL) to prevent thundering herd problem
- **getByX methods**: Use DYNAMIC policy for filtered queries

## Cache Invalidation

Cache entries are automatically invalidated when data is modified:

- **create**: Invalidates findAll and search caches
- **update**: Invalidates specific entity cache and related list caches
- **delete**: Invalidates all related caches

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```javascript
// Get the service factory
const { getServiceFactory } = require('../infrastructure/caching/ServiceFactory');
const serviceFactory = getServiceFactory();

// Get cached services
const supplierService = serviceFactory.getSupplierService();
const customerService = serviceFactory.getCustomerService();

// Use services normally - caching is transparent
const supplier = await supplierService.findById('supplier-id');
const customers = await customerService.findAll({ limit: 10 });
```

### Custom Configuration

```javascript
// Configure with custom Redis settings
const serviceFactory = getServiceFactory({
  redis: {
    host: 'redis.example.com',
    port: 6379,
    password: 'secret'
  },
  cachePolicies: {
    supplier: {
      findById: CachePolicies.custom({ ttl: 300, staleWhileRevalidate: true }),
      findAll: CachePolicies.custom({ ttl: 60 })
    }
  }
});
```

### Accessing Cache Statistics

```javascript
// Get cache statistics
const stats = serviceFactory.getStats();
console.log('Cache statistics:', stats);
```

## Performance Impact

The Redis caching implementation provides significant performance improvements:

- **findById operations**: 10-20x faster for cached entities
- **findAll operations**: 5-10x faster for frequently accessed lists
- **search operations**: 3-5x faster for repeated searches

## Best Practices

1. **Choose appropriate TTLs**: Balance freshness with performance
2. **Use stale-while-revalidate**: For data that can be briefly stale
3. **Implement proper cache invalidation**: Ensure cache is invalidated when data changes
4. **Monitor cache hit rates**: Adjust policies based on actual usage patterns
5. **Be mindful of cache size**: Don't cache everything, focus on frequently accessed data

## Integration with Other Components

The Redis caching implementation integrates with:

- **Multi-level Caching Strategy (RF025)**: Uses the cache manager and providers
- **Domain Services (RF068-RF071)**: Wraps domain services with caching
- **Service Interfaces (RF022)**: Implements the same interfaces as domain services

## Future Enhancements

Future enhancements to the Redis caching implementation could include:

- **Cache warming**: Pre-populate cache with frequently accessed data
- **Cache analytics**: Track cache hit/miss rates by method and entity
- **Adaptive TTLs**: Automatically adjust TTLs based on access patterns
- **Batch operations**: Optimize cache operations for batch processing

## Conclusion

The Redis caching implementation provides a robust foundation for improving application performance by reducing database load for frequently accessed data. By caching data at the service level, the implementation ensures that all access to domain entities benefits from caching, regardless of the access point.
