# Docker and Deployment Standards

## Dockerfile Best Practices
- Use multi-stage builds for optimization
- Use specific base image versions
- Minimize layer count
- Copy package files before source code
- Use .dockerignore to exclude unnecessary files
- Run as non-root user when possible

## Docker Compose
- Use version 3.x syntax
- Define proper service dependencies
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Implement health checks
- Use named volumes for persistence
- Set proper resource limits

## Security
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Use minimal base images
- Don't run containers as root
- Keep base images updated
- Use secrets for sensitive data
- Implement proper network isolation

## Performance
- Optimize image sizes
- Use build cache effectively
- Implement proper logging
- Monitor resource usage
- Use appropriate restart policies

## Development Workflow
- Use docker-compose for local development
- Implement hot reloading
- Use volume mounts for development
- Keep production and development configs separate
- Document container setup process
