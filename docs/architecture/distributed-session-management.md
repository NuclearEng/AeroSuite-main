# Distributed Session Management

## Overview

This document describes the distributed session management system implemented in the AeroSuite
project as part of RF038. The system enables session data to be shared across multiple server
instances, ensuring a seamless user experience in a horizontally scaled environment.

## Introduction

In a distributed environment with multiple server instances, traditional in-memory session storage
doesn't work because user requests might be routed to different servers on subsequent requests.
Distributed session management solves this problem by storing session data in a centralized
location accessible by all server instances.

### Key Benefits

- __Horizontal Scalability__: Sessions work reliably across multiple server instances
- __High Availability__: No single point of failure for session data
- __Improved Security__: Enhanced session validation and security features
- __Better User Experience__: Seamless user experience even when scaling the application
- __Real-time Communication__: Cross-instance events and notifications

## Architecture

The distributed session management system uses a Redis-based architecture with the following key
components:

1. __Central Session Store__: Redis is used as a central repository for session data
2. __Pub/Sub Messaging__: Redis pub/sub for real-time communication between instances
3. __Session Security__: Enhanced security with fingerprinting and validation
4. __Middleware Layer__: Express middleware for easy integration
5. __API Layer__: REST API for session management operations
