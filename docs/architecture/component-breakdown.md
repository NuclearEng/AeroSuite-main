# Component Breakdown Strategy

## Overview

This document outlines the strategy for breaking down large UI components in the AeroSuite application. The goal is to improve code maintainability, reusability, and performance by following component composition principles.

## Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component should have only one reason to change.
2. **Composition Over Inheritance**: Build complex UIs by composing small, focused components.
3. **Reusability**: Components should be designed for reuse across the application.
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Separate UI, state management, and business logic.
5. **Testability**: Smaller components are easier to test in isolation.

## Breakdown Strategy

### 1. Common UI Elements

Extract common UI elements into reusable components:

- `LoadingState`: For displaying loading spinners
- `ErrorState`: For displaying error messages with retry options
- `EmptyState`: For displaying empty state messages
- `PaginationFooter`: For standardized pagination controls

### 2. Feature-Specific Components

Break down feature-specific components into smaller, focused parts:

- Headers (e.g., `ActivityHistoryHeader`)
- Filters (e.g., `ActivityFilters`)
- List items (e.g., `ActivityTimelineItem`)
- Form sections (e.g., `TagInput`, `FormHeader`)

### 3. Container Components

Container components manage state and data fetching, while delegating rendering to presentational components:

- `CustomerActivityHistory` (container) uses:
  - `ActivityHistoryHeader` (presentational)
  - `ActivityFilters` (presentational)
  - `ActivityTimeline` (presentational)
  - `PaginationFooter` (presentational)

## Benefits

- **Improved Readability**: Smaller components are easier to understand
- **Better Maintainability**: Changes to one component don't affect others
- **Enhanced Reusability**: Components can be reused across the application
- **Code Splitting**: Enables more efficient code splitting for performance
- **Parallel Development**: Multiple developers can work on different components
- **Easier Testing**: Smaller components are easier to test in isolation

## Examples

### Before Refactoring

Before refactoring, components like `CustomerActivityHistory` contained all UI elements, state management, and rendering logic in a single file, making them difficult to maintain and test.

### After Refactoring

After refactoring, we have:

- `ActivityHistoryHeader`: Responsible only for rendering the header
- `ActivityFilters`: Handles filter UI and interactions
- `ActivityTimelineItem`: Renders a single timeline item
- `ActivityTimeline`: Composes timeline items and handles empty/loading/error states
- `PaginationFooter`: Manages pagination UI
- `CustomerActivityHistory`: Orchestrates these components and manages state

## Next Steps

1. Create a comprehensive UI component library (RF014)
2. Implement component composition patterns (RF015)
3. Create component documentation (RF016)
