# Domain Boundaries Definition Workshop

## Introduction

This document outlines the domain boundaries for the AeroSuite application based on Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. It serves as a reference for understanding how the system is divided into bounded contexts and how these contexts interact with each other.

## Core Domains

AeroSuite is divided into the following core domains:

### 1. Supplier Management Domain

**Responsibility**: Managing all supplier-related data and operations.

**Key Aggregates**:
- Supplier (Aggregate Root)
- SupplierContact
- SupplierQualification
- SupplierPerformance

**Domain Events**:
- SupplierCreated
- SupplierUpdated
- SupplierStatusChanged
- SupplierQualificationAdded
- SupplierPerformanceUpdated

**Domain Services**:
- SupplierQualificationService
- SupplierRiskAssessmentService
- SupplierPerformanceAnalyticsService

### 2. Customer Management Domain

**Responsibility**: Managing all customer-related data and operations.

**Key Aggregates**:
- Customer (Aggregate Root)
- CustomerContact
- CustomerActivity

**Domain Events**:
- CustomerCreated
- CustomerUpdated
- CustomerStatusChanged
- CustomerActivityRecorded

**Domain Services**:
- CustomerAnalyticsService
- CustomerCommunicationService

### 3. Inspection Management Domain

**Responsibility**: Managing inspection processes, checklists, and results.

**Key Aggregates**:
- Inspection (Aggregate Root)
- InspectionItem
- Defect
- InspectionAttachment

**Domain Events**:
- InspectionCreated
- InspectionScheduled
- InspectionCompleted
- DefectRecorded
- DefectResolved

**Domain Services**:
- InspectionSchedulingService
- DefectAnalysisService
- InspectionReportGenerationService

### 4. Component Management Domain

**Responsibility**: Managing technical components, specifications, and revisions.

**Key Aggregates**:

**Domain Events**:
- ComponentCreated
- ComponentUpdated
- ComponentStatusUpdated
- SpecificationAdded
- RevisionCreated

**Domain Services**:

## Supporting Domains

### 1. User Management Domain

**Responsibility**: Managing user accounts, authentication, and authorization.

**Key Aggregates**:
- User (Aggregate Root)
- Role
- Permission

### 2. Notification Domain

**Responsibility**: Managing system notifications and alerts.

**Key Aggregates**:
- Notification (Aggregate Root)
- NotificationTemplate
- NotificationChannel

### 3. Reporting Domain

**Responsibility**: Generating reports and analytics.

**Key Aggregates**:
- Report (Aggregate Root)
- ReportTemplate
- Dashboard

## Domain Boundaries and Interactions

### Boundary Definition Principles

1. **Linguistic Boundaries**: Each domain has its own ubiquitous language.
2. **Responsibility Boundaries**: Clear separation of concerns between domains.
3. **Data Ownership**: Each piece of data has a clear owner domain.
4. **Autonomous Operation**: Domains should be able to function independently.

### Cross-Domain Interactions

#### Integration Patterns

1. **Domain Events**: Domains communicate primarily through domain events.
2. **Anti-Corruption Layers**: Used when integrating with external systems or legacy code.
3. **Shared Kernels**: Limited shared models between closely related domains.
4. **Customer/Supplier**: When one domain depends on another in a customer-supplier relationship.

#### Key Interactions

1. **Inspection ↔ Supplier**:
   - Inspections are often conducted for specific suppliers
   - Supplier performance metrics are updated based on inspection results

2. **Inspection ↔ Component**:
   - Inspections verify component specifications
   - Component revisions may be triggered by inspection findings

3. **Component ↔ Supplier**:
   - Components are provided by suppliers
   - Supplier qualifications may be specific to certain component categories

4. **Customer ↔ Inspection**:
   - Inspections may be requested by or conducted for customers
   - Inspection results are shared with relevant customers

## Strategic Design Decisions

### Core vs. Supporting Domains

- **Core Domains**: Supplier, Customer, Inspection, and Component domains represent the core business capabilities of AeroSuite.
- **Supporting Domains**: User, Notification, and Reporting domains provide essential infrastructure but are not the main business differentiators.

### Domain Relationships

1. **Partnership**: Inspection and Component domains work closely together in a partnership relationship.
2. **Customer/Supplier**: Reporting domain is a customer of all other domains, consuming their data.
3. **Conformist**: Notification domain conforms to the event structures of other domains.
4. **Anti-Corruption Layer**: Used when integrating with external ERP systems to protect domain models.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Domain Isolation

- Each domain should have its own directory structure in the codebase
- Domain models should not directly reference models from other domains
- Cross-domain references should be by ID only or through well-defined interfaces

### Domain Events

- Events should be named in past tense (e.g., "ComponentCreated")
- Events should contain only the data necessary for consumers
- Event handlers should be loosely coupled to event producers

### Shared Kernel

The following concepts may be shared across domains:
- Common value objects (e.g., Address, Money)
- Base entity and aggregate classes
- Common validation rules

## Next Steps

1. Conduct detailed domain modeling sessions for each domain
2. Document the ubiquitous language for each domain
3. Create context mapping documentation (RF010)
4. Implement anti-corruption layers where needed (RF011)
5. Implement domain events integration between contexts (RF012)
