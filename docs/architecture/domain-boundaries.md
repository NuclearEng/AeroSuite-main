# Domain Boundaries Definition Workshop

## Introduction

This document outlines the domain boundaries for the AeroSuite application based on Domain-Driven
Design (DDD) principles. It serves as a reference for understanding how the system is divided into
bounded contexts and how these contexts interact with each other.

## Core Domains

AeroSuite is divided into the following core domains:

### 1. Supplier Management Domain

__Responsibility__: Managing all supplier-related data and operations.

__Key Aggregates__:
- Supplier (Aggregate Root)
- SupplierContact
- SupplierQualification
- SupplierPerformance

__Domain Events__:
- SupplierCreated
- SupplierUpdated
- SupplierStatusChanged
- SupplierQualificationAdded
- SupplierPerformanceUpdated

__Domain Services__:
- SupplierQualificationService
- SupplierRiskAssessmentService
- SupplierPerformanceAnalyticsService

### 2. Customer Management Domain

__Responsibility__: Managing all customer-related data and operations.

__Key Aggregates__:
- Customer (Aggregate Root)
- CustomerContact
- CustomerActivity

__Domain Events__:
- CustomerCreated
- CustomerUpdated
- CustomerStatusChanged
- CustomerActivityRecorded

__Domain Services__:
- CustomerAnalyticsService
- CustomerCommunicationService

### 3. Inspection Management Domain

__Responsibility__: Managing inspection processes, checklists, and results.

__Key Aggregates__:
- Inspection (Aggregate Root)
- InspectionItem
- Defect
- InspectionAttachment

__Domain Events__:
- InspectionCreated
- InspectionScheduled
- InspectionCompleted
- DefectRecorded
- DefectResolved

__Domain Services__:
- InspectionSchedulingService

### 2. Notification Domain

__Responsibility__: Managing system notifications and alerts.

__Key Aggregates__:
- Notification (Aggregate Root)
- NotificationTemplate
- NotificationChannel

### 3. Reporting Domain

__Responsibility__: Generating reports and analytics.

__Key Aggregates__:
- Report (Aggregate Root)
- ReportTemplate
- Dashboard

## Domain Boundaries and Interactions

### Boundary Definition Principles

1. __Linguistic Boundaries__: Each domain has its own ubiquitous language.
2. __Responsibility Boundaries__: Clear separation of concerns between domains.
3. __Data Ownership__: Each piece of data has a clear owner domain.
4. __Autonomous Operation__: Domains should be able to function independently.

### Cross-Domain Interactions

#### Integration Patterns

1. __Domain Events__: Domains communicate primarily through domain events.
2. __Anti-Corruption Layers__: Used when integrating with external systems or legacy code.
3. __Shared Kernels__: Limited shared models between closely related domains.
4. __Customer/Supplier__: When one domain depends on another in a customer-supplier relationship.

#### Key Interactions

1. __Inspection ↔ Supplier__:
   - Inspections are often conducted for specific suppliers
   - Supplier performance metrics are updated based on inspection results

2. __Inspection ↔ Component__:
   - Inspections verify component specifications
   - Component revisions may be triggered by inspection findings

3. __Component ↔ Supplier__:
   - Components are provided by suppliers
   - Supplier qualifications may be specific to certain component categories

4. __Customer ↔ Inspection__:
   - Inspections may be requested by or conducted for customers
   - Inspection results are shared with relevant customers

## Strategic Design Decisions

### Core vs. Supporting Domains

- __Core Domains__: Supplier, Customer, Inspection, and Component domains represent the core
business capabilities of AeroSuite.
- __Supporting Domains__: User, Notification, and Reporting domains provide essential
infrastructure but are not the main business differentiators.

### Domain Relationships

1. __Partnership__: Inspection and Component domains work closely together in a partnership
relationship.
2. __Customer/Supplier__: Reporting domain is a customer of all other domains, consuming their data.
3. __Conformist__: Notification domain conforms to the event structures of other domains.
4. __Anti-Corruption Layer__: Used when integrating with external ERP systems to protect domain
models.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Domain Isolation

- Each domain should have its own directory structure in the codebase
- Domain models should not directly reference models from other domains
- Cross-domain references should be by ID only or through well-defined interfaces

### Domain Events

- Events should be named in past tense (e.g., "ComponentCreated")
- Events should contain only the data necessary for consumers
- Event handlers should be loosely coupled to event producers

### Shared Kernel

The following concepts may be shared across domains:
- Common value objects (e.g., Address, Money)
- Base entity and aggregate classes
- Common validation rules

## Next Steps

1. Conduct detailed domain modeling sessions for each domain
2. Document the ubiquitous language for each domain
3. Create context mapping documentation (RF010)
4. Implement anti-corruption layers where needed (RF011)
5. Implement domain events integration between contexts (RF012)
