## Legend

### Relationship Types

- __Partnership__: Close collaboration with aligned goals
- __Customer-Supplier__: One context provides services to another
- __Conformist__: One context adapts to the model of another
- __Separate Ways__: Minimal direct interaction
- __Open Host Service__: Well-defined API for others to use
- __Anti-Corruption Layer__: Translation layer between different models

### Integration Mechanisms

- __Domain Events__: Asynchronous communication via events
- __API__: Synchronous communication via REST or GraphQL APIs
- __Shared Kernel__: Shared code and models between domains
- __Published Language__: Shared schema for communication
- __Read Models__: Denormalized data optimized for specific use cases
- __Adapters__: Components that translate between different models
