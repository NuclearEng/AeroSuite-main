# AeroSuite Architecture Documentation

This directory contains architectural documentation for the AeroSuite project, including Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) and other architectural artifacts.

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

ADRs are documents that capture an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. They are a lightweight way to document the "why" behind architectural decisions.

### Why ADRs?

- **Institutional Memory**: Preserve the context and reasoning behind decisions
- **Onboarding**: Help new team members understand why things are the way they are
- **Future Decision Making**: Provide context for future decisions
- **Communication**: Facilitate discussion around architectural changes

### ADR Format

Each ADR follows a standard format:

1. **Title**: A descriptive title that summarizes the decision
2. **Status**: Current status (Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded)
3. **Context**: The problem being addressed and relevant background
4. **Decision Drivers**: Factors that influenced the decision
5. **Considered Options**: Alternatives that were considered
6. **Decision**: The decision that was made and the rationale
7. **Consequences**: Positive and negative outcomes of the decision
8. **Implementation Notes**: Details on how to implement the decision
9. **Related Decisions**: Links to related ADRs
10. **References**: External references and resources

### Current ADRs

| ID | Title | Status | Description |
|----|-------|--------|-------------|
| [ADR-001](./adr-001-domain-driven-design.md) | Adoption of Domain-Driven Design Architecture | Accepted | Implementation of Domain-Driven Design principles across the AeroSuite platform |

### Creating New ADRs

To create a new ADR:

1. Copy the [ADR template](./adr-template.md)
2. Name it following the convention `adr-NNN-title-with-hyphens.md` where NNN is the next available number
3. Fill in the sections according to the template
4. Update this README.md to include the new ADR in the table above
