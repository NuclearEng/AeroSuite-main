# Domain Boundaries Definition Workshop Agenda

## Workshop Details

- **Date**: [TBD]
- **Time**: 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM
- **Location**: [TBD]
- **Facilitator**: [TBD]

## Objectives

1. Define clear domain boundaries for the AeroSuite application
2. Identify bounded contexts and their relationships
3. Document the ubiquitous language for each domain
4. Create a context map showing domain interactions
5. Establish guidelines for domain isolation and integration

## Pre-Workshop Preparation

1. Participants should review:
   - Current domain models in the codebase
   - Business requirements documentation
   - Basic DDD concepts (pre-reading materials will be provided)
   
2. Prepare examples of:
   - Current pain points in the system architecture
   - Cross-cutting concerns and integration challenges
   - Business processes that span multiple domains

## Agenda

### 9:00 AM - 9:30 AM: Introduction
- Welcome and workshop objectives
- Introduction to Domain-Driven Design concepts
- Overview of the current system architecture

### 9:30 AM - 11:30 AM: Domain Storytelling
- Business experts narrate key business processes
- Technical team captures processes as domain stories
- Identify key domain concepts, actors, and workflows
- Document domain-specific terminology

### 11:30 AM - 12:30 PM: Lunch Break

### 12:30 PM - 1:30 PM: Identifying Bounded Contexts
- Review domain stories to identify distinct domains
- Define responsibilities for each domain
- Identify domain boundaries based on:
  - Business capabilities
  - Team organization
  - Data ownership
  - Language boundaries

### 1:30 PM - 3:30 PM: Context Mapping Exercise
- Identify relationships between domains
- Define integration patterns for each relationship:
  - Shared Kernel
  - Customer/Supplier
  - Conformist
  - Anti-Corruption Layer
  - Open Host Service
  - Published Language
  - Separate Ways
- Create visual context map

### 3:30 PM - 3:45 PM: Break

### 3:45 PM - 4:45 PM: Implementation Discussion
- Technical implementation of domain boundaries
- Domain events design and integration
- Repository design and data access patterns
- API design for cross-domain communication
- Testing strategies for bounded contexts

### 4:45 PM - 5:00 PM: Next Steps and Action Items
- Summarize key decisions
- Assign action items
- Plan follow-up activities
- Schedule domain-specific deep dive sessions

## Workshop Materials

- Whiteboard or digital collaboration tool
- Sticky notes and markers
- Printed domain model diagrams
- Current system architecture diagrams
- Business process documentation

## Expected Outcomes

1. Documented domain boundaries
2. Context map showing domain relationships
3. List of domain events for cross-domain communication
4. Implementation guidelines for domain isolation
5. Action items for follow-up activities

## Post-Workshop Activities

1. Document workshop outcomes
2. Create detailed context mapping documentation (RF010)
3. Update domain models based on workshop decisions
4. Plan implementation of anti-corruption layers (RF011)
5. Design domain events integration (RF012)

## Notes for Facilitator

- Ensure balanced participation from both business and technical team members
- Focus discussions on business capabilities rather than technical implementation
- Use real business scenarios to drive the discussion
- Capture disagreements and open questions for follow-up
- Take regular breaks to maintain energy and focus
