## Legend

### Relationship Types

- **Partnership**: Close collaboration with aligned goals
- **Customer-Supplier**: One context provides services to another
- **Conformist**: One context adapts to the model of another
- **Separate Ways**: Minimal direct interaction
- **Open Host Service**: Well-defined API for others to use
- **Anti-Corruption Layer**: Translation layer between different models

### Integration Mechanisms

- **Domain Events**: Asynchronous communication via events
- **API**: Synchronous communication via REST or GraphQL APIs
- **Shared Kernel**: Shared code and models between domains
- **Published Language**: Shared schema for communication
- **Read Models**: Denormalized data optimized for specific use cases
- **Adapters**: Components that translate between different models

## Domain Responsibility Summary

| Domain | Primary Responsibility | Key Integration Points |
|--------|------------------------|------------------------|
| Customer | Managing customer data and relationships | Provides customer data to Inspection domain |
| Supplier | Managing supplier data and qualifications | Provides supplier data to Component domain |
| Inspection | Managing inspection processes and results | Consumes data from Customer, Component; Updates Supplier performance |
| Component | Managing component specifications and revisions | Consumes data from Supplier; Provides specifications to Inspection |
| User | Managing authentication and authorization | Provides identity services to all domains |
| Reporting | Generating analytics and reports | Consumes events from all domains |
| Notification | Managing notifications and alerts | Consumes events from all domains |
