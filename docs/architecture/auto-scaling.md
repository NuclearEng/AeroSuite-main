# Auto-Scaling Configuration

## Overview

This document describes the auto-scaling system implemented in the AeroSuite project as part of
RF039. The system enables automatic scaling of services based on resource utilization and traffic
patterns, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.

## Introduction

Auto-scaling is a critical capability for modern cloud-native applications, allowing them to handle
varying loads efficiently by automatically adjusting the number of running instances. AeroSuite
implements a comprehensive auto-scaling solution that works at both the application level and
infrastructure level.

### Key Benefits

- __Cost Optimization__: Scale down during low-traffic periods to reduce resource costs
- __Performance Reliability__: Scale up during high-traffic periods to maintain performance
- __High Availability__: Ensure service availability even during traffic spikes
- __Resource Efficiency__: Optimize resource utilization across the system
- __Predictive Scaling__: Use traffic patterns to scale proactively before demand increases

## Architecture

The auto-scaling system uses a multi-layered approach:

1. __Application-Level Metrics Collection__: Each service instance collects and reports its own
metrics
2. __Centralized Metrics Aggregation__: Redis is used to aggregate metrics across all instances
3. __Scaling Decision Engine__: Analyzes metrics and determines when to scale
4. __Kubernetes Integration__: Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs) implement the scaling decisions
5. __Monitoring and Feedback__: Continuous monitoring of scaling effectiveness
