# ADR-002: AI/ML Architecture for AeroSuite

## Status

Accepted

## Context

AeroSuite has plans to integrate advanced AI/ML capabilities including computer vision for defect detection, predictive analytics for supplier performance, document processing, and anomaly detection. These features require a robust, scalable, and maintainable AI/ML architecture that integrates well with the existing system while allowing for independent evolution of ML models.

Key challenges include:
- Ensuring ML models can be developed, trained, and deployed independently
- Managing ML model lifecycle including versioning, monitoring, and updates
- Handling large datasets for training and inference
- Providing consistent APIs for ML services
- Ensuring explainability and transparency of AI decisions
- Maintaining performance at scale

## Decision

We will implement a Model-as-a-Service architecture for AI/ML integration with the following components:

1. **ML Service Layer**:
   - Independent microservices for each ML capability
   - Standardized REST/gRPC APIs for model inference
   - Clear contracts between ML services and core application

2. **Feature Engineering Pipeline**:
   - Centralized feature store for consistent feature extraction
   - Feature versioning and lineage tracking
   - Reusable feature transformations

3. **Model Training Infrastructure**:
   - Containerized training environments
   - Experiment tracking and versioning
   - Automated evaluation and validation

4. **Model Registry and Deployment**:
   - Version control for ML models
   - A/B testing capabilities
   - Canary deployments for new models

5. **Model Monitoring**:
   - Performance metrics tracking
   - Data drift detection
   - Automated retraining triggers

6. **Explainability Layer**:
   - Tools for understanding model decisions
   - Confidence scores for predictions
   - Visualization of decision factors

## Implementation Approach

1. **Technology Stack**:
   - PyTorch/TensorFlow for model development
   - ONNX for model interoperability
   - MLflow for experiment tracking
   - Kubernetes for deployment orchestration
   - Prometheus/Grafana for monitoring

2. **Integration Pattern**:
   - ML services will expose REST/gRPC endpoints
   - Asynchronous processing for batch operations
   - Streaming for real-time predictions

3. **Development Workflow**:
   - Data scientists work in notebooks/ML environments
   - CI/CD pipeline for model training and deployment
   - Automated testing for ML components

4. **Data Management**:
   - Data versioning for training datasets
   - Data quality validation pipeline
   - Privacy-preserving techniques for sensitive data

## Consequences

### Positive

- Clear separation between ML services and core application
- Independent scaling of ML components
- Easier experimentation and iteration on models
- Consistent monitoring and observability
- Foundation for responsible AI practices
- Flexibility to adopt new ML techniques and frameworks

### Negative

- Increased system complexity
- Additional infrastructure requirements
- Need for specialized ML engineering skills
- Potential latency from service boundaries
- Challenges in debugging distributed ML systems

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Embedded ML Models**: Simpler but limits scalability and independent development.

2. **Third-party ML Services**: Would reduce development effort but limit customization and control.

3. **Monolithic ML System**: Would simplify integration but limit independent scaling and evolution.
