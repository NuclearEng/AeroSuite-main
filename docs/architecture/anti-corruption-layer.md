# Anti-Corruption Layer Implementation

## Overview

The Anti-Corruption Layer (ACL) is a pattern from Domain-Driven Design that isolates domain models from external system models. In AeroSuite, we've implemented an ACL to protect our domain models from being influenced by external ERP systems (SAP and Oracle).

## Purpose

The ACL serves several important purposes:

1. **Domain Model Protection**: Prevents external system concepts from leaking into our domain models
2. **Bidirectional Translation**: Translates between domain models and external system models
3. **Isolation**: Isolates changes in external systems from affecting our domain logic
4. **Flexibility**: Allows us to integrate with multiple ERP systems without compromising our domain model

## Implementation

Our ACL implementation consists of the following components:

### 1. Base Anti-Corruption Layer

The `BaseAntiCorruptionLayer` class provides common functionality for all ACL implementations:

- Translation methods (to/from domain model)
- Batch translation methods
- Validation utilities
- Error handling and logging

### 2. Provider-Specific ACL Implementations

We've implemented specific ACL classes for each ERP provider:

- `SapAntiCorruptionLayer`: Translates between SAP ERP models and AeroSuite domain models
- `OracleAntiCorruptionLayer`: Translates between Oracle ERP models and AeroSuite domain models

Each implementation defines entity mappings and translation logic specific to that ERP system.

### 3. Anti-Corruption Layer Factory

The `AntiCorruptionLayerFactory` creates the appropriate ACL implementation based on the configured ERP provider:

```javascript
// Create an ACL instance based on configuration
const aclInstance = AntiCorruptionLayerFactory.createFromConfig();

// Use the ACL to translate data
const domainSupplier = aclInstance.translateToDomain('supplier', erpSupplier);
```

### 4. Enhanced ERP Service

The `EnhancedERPService` uses the ACL to provide a clean interface for interacting with ERP systems:

```javascript
// Get suppliers from ERP, translated to domain model
const suppliers = await enhancedErpService.getSuppliers();

// Create a supplier in ERP
const createdSupplier = await enhancedErpService.createSupplier(domainSupplier);

// Sync suppliers between AeroSuite and ERP
await enhancedErpService.syncSuppliersToERP();
await enhancedErpService.syncSuppliersFromERP();
```

## Entity Mappings

The ACL handles translation for the following entity types:

| Domain Entity | SAP Entity | Oracle Entity |
|---------------|------------|--------------|
| Supplier | Business Partner (CardType 'S') | Vendor |
| Inspection | Quality Inspection | Inspection |
| Purchase Order | Purchase Order | Purchase Order |
| Component | Item | Inventory Item |

## Translation Process

The translation process involves the following steps:

1. **Validation**: Ensure the required fields are present in the source data
2. **Mapping**: Map fields from source format to target format
3. **Enrichment**: Add additional metadata or derived fields
4. **Error Handling**: Handle and log any translation errors

## Usage Examples

### Translating from ERP to Domain Model

```javascript
// Get the appropriate ACL instance
const acl = require('../infrastructure/anti-corruption-layer').createAcl();

// Get data from ERP system
const erpSuppliers = await erpService.getVendors();

// Translate to domain model
const domainSuppliers = acl.batchTranslateToDomain('supplier', erpSuppliers);

// Use the domain suppliers in our application
await processDomainSuppliers(domainSuppliers);
```

### Translating from Domain Model to ERP

```javascript
// Get the appropriate ACL instance
const acl = require('../infrastructure/anti-corruption-layer').createAcl();

// Get domain entities
const domainSuppliers = await supplierRepository.findAll();

// Translate to ERP format
const erpSuppliers = acl.batchTranslateFromDomain('supplier', domainSuppliers);

// Send to ERP system
await erpService.createVendors(erpSuppliers);
```

## Benefits

The ACL implementation provides several benefits:

1. **Clean Domain Model**: Our domain model remains clean and focused on business logic
2. **Multiple ERP Support**: We can easily support multiple ERP systems
3. **Testability**: The translation logic is isolated and easily testable
4. **Maintainability**: Changes in ERP systems don't affect our domain logic
5. **Flexibility**: We can change or extend our domain model without affecting ERP integration

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to the ACL implementation:

1. **Caching**: Add caching for frequently accessed ERP data
2. **Versioning**: Support versioning of ERP interfaces
3. **Additional Providers**: Add support for more ERP systems
4. **Event-Based Sync**: Implement event-based synchronization between systems
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Add more sophisticated conflict resolution strategies

## Conclusion

The Anti-Corruption Layer implementation provides a clean separation between our domain models and external ERP systems. This separation allows us to maintain a clean domain model while still integrating with complex external systems.
