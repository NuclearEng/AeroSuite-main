# ADR-001: Adoption of Domain-Driven Design Architecture

## Status

Accepted

## Context

The AeroSuite application has grown organically, resulting in a codebase with mixed concerns, 
unclear boundaries between components, and difficulty in maintaining and extending the system. As 
we prepare to add AI/ML capabilities and scale the application, we need a more structured approach 
to our architecture that can accommodate complex business rules while keeping the codebase 
maintainable.

We need to address several issues:
1. Business logic is scattered across controllers, services, and even UI components
2. Domain concepts are not clearly defined or consistently used
3. Cross-cutting concerns like validation and error handling are implemented inconsistently
4. The system lacks clear boundaries between different functional areas
5. It's difficult to test business logic in isolation

## Decision Drivers

* Need for a more maintainable and scalable codebase
* Desire to align technical implementation with business domains
* Requirement to support complex business rules and workflows
* Need to isolate core business logic from infrastructure concerns
* Preparation for future AI/ML integration that will require clear domain models
* Need for better testability of business logic

## Considered Options

* __Continue with current architecture__: Keep the existing architecture and make incremental 
improvements.
* __Layered Architecture__: Implement a traditional layered architecture (presentation, business, 
data).
* __Domain-Driven Design (DDD)__: Adopt DDD principles with bounded contexts, aggregates, entities, 
value objects, and domain services.
* __Microservices Architecture__: Decompose the application into separate microservices.
* __Clean Architecture__: Implement Uncle Bob's Clean Architecture with use cases and entities.

## Decision

Chosen option: "Domain-Driven Design (DDD)", because:

1. It provides a structured approach to modeling complex domains, which aligns with our business 
needs
2. It creates clear boundaries between different parts of the system through bounded contexts
3. It separates domain logic from infrastructure concerns, improving testability
4. It provides patterns for handling complex business rules and workflows
5. It creates a shared language between developers and domain experts
6. It provides a clear path for evolving the architecture as the business grows
7. It offers better support for our future AI/ML integration plans by having well-defined domain 
models

## Consequences

### Positive

* Clear separation of concerns with domain logic isolated from infrastructure
* Improved communication between technical and business teams through ubiquitous language
* Better testability of business logic
* More maintainable codebase with clear boundaries
* Easier to extend and modify as business rules change
* Better support for complex business workflows
* Clearer path to integrating AI/ML capabilities

### Negative

* Learning curve for the team to understand and apply DDD concepts
* Initial development might be slower as we establish patterns and practices
* Need for refactoring existing code to fit the new architecture
* Risk of over-engineering simple parts of the application
* Additional abstraction layers may add complexity

## Implementation Notes

* We will implement the core DDD building blocks:
  - Entities with identity and lifecycle
  - Value Objects for descriptive concepts without identity
  - Aggregates as consistency boundaries
  - Domain Events for cross-aggregate communication
  - Repositories for persistence abstraction
  - Domain Services for operations that don't belong to entities
  - Application Services to orchestrate use cases

* We will start by identifying bounded contexts and creating a context map
* We will implement an anti-corruption layer where needed to integrate with external systems
* We will use a hexagonal architecture pattern to separate domain logic from infrastructure
* We will create a shared kernel for concepts used across multiple bounded contexts
* We will implement domain events for communication between bounded contexts
