# Context Mapping Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed context map for the AeroSuite application, defining the relationships between bounded contexts (domains) and specifying the integration patterns used for communication between them. Context mapping is a strategic design tool in Domain-Driven Design that helps visualize and manage the boundaries and interactions between different domains.

## Context Map Overview

The context map illustrates how the various domains in AeroSuite relate to each other and defines the nature of these relationships. Each relationship follows specific integration patterns that determine how the domains communicate and share data.

## Domain Relationship Patterns

In DDD, several patterns define how bounded contexts relate to each other. The key patterns used in AeroSuite are:

1. **Partnership**: Two teams collaborate closely with aligned goals.
2. **Customer-Supplier**: One context provides services to another context.
3. **Conformist**: One context adapts to the model of another context.
4. **Anti-Corruption Layer**: A layer that translates between different models.
5. **Open Host Service**: A context publishes a well-defined API for others to use.
6. **Published Language**: A shared language used for communication between contexts.
7. **Separate Ways**: Contexts decide to have no connection at all.
8. **Shared Kernel**: Contexts share a subset of their domain models.

## Detailed Context Relationships

### 1. Customer Domain ↔ Inspection Domain

**Relationship Type**: Customer-Supplier
- **Upstream**: Customer Domain
- **Downstream**: Inspection Domain

**Integration Mechanism**: Domain Events + Open Host Service
- Customer Domain publishes events like `CustomerCreated` and `CustomerStatusChanged`
- Inspection Domain subscribes to these events to associate inspections with customers
- Inspection Domain provides an API for the Customer Domain to request inspections

**Data Exchange**:
- Customer Domain shares customer information needed for inspections
- Inspection Domain shares inspection results related to specific customers

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for data exchange to avoid direct model dependencies
- Implement versioning for APIs to handle evolution of both domains
- Consider caching frequently accessed customer data in the Inspection Domain

**Potential Conflicts**:
- Changes to customer data structure might impact inspection processes
- Different requirements for customer data between domains

**Resolution Strategy**:
- Regular communication between teams
- Clear API contracts with versioning
- Explicit translation layer in Inspection Domain for customer data

### 2. Inspection Domain ↔ Component Domain

**Relationship Type**: Partnership
- Both domains work closely together with aligned goals

**Integration Mechanism**: Shared Kernel + Domain Events
- Both domains share common concepts related to component specifications and inspection criteria
- Component Domain publishes events like `ComponentCreated` and `SpecificationAdded`
- Inspection Domain publishes events like `DefectRecorded` and `InspectionCompleted`

**Shared Kernel Elements**:
- Specification validation rules
- Measurement units and conversions
- Tolerance calculations

**Data Exchange**:
- Component Domain provides specifications and tolerances
- Inspection Domain provides inspection results and defects

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Clearly define and document the shared kernel
- Establish joint governance for changes to shared kernel
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout of changes affecting both domains

**Potential Conflicts**:
- Different interpretations of specification requirements
- Competing priorities for changes to shared concepts

**Resolution Strategy**:
- Joint modeling sessions
- Shared test suite for the shared kernel
- Cross-team code reviews for changes to shared elements

### 3. Component Domain ↔ Supplier Domain

**Relationship Type**: Customer-Supplier
- **Upstream**: Supplier Domain
- **Downstream**: Component Domain

**Integration Mechanism**: Domain Events + Published Language
- Supplier Domain publishes events like `SupplierCreated` and `SupplierQualificationAdded`
- Component Domain subscribes to these events to associate components with suppliers
- Both domains use a published language for supplier capabilities and component requirements

**Published Language Elements**:
- Supplier capability definitions
- Component sourcing requirements
- Qualification criteria

**Data Exchange**:
- Supplier Domain shares supplier capabilities and qualifications
- Component Domain shares component requirements and specifications

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Define the published language as a separate module
- Version the published language explicitly
- Implement translation to/from the published language in both domains

**Potential Conflicts**:
- Different understanding of supplier capabilities
- Changes to qualification criteria affecting component sourcing

**Resolution Strategy**:
- Explicit schema definition for the published language
- Versioning strategy for the published language
- Regular review of the published language by both teams

### 4. Supplier Domain ↔ Customer Domain

**Relationship Type**: Separate Ways
- These domains have minimal direct interaction

**Integration Mechanism**: None (or via other domains)
- Any necessary communication happens through the Inspection Domain
- No direct dependencies between these domains

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Ensure no direct references between these domains
- Use the Inspection Domain as an intermediary when needed

### 5. User Domain ↔ All Other Domains

**Relationship Type**: Open Host Service
- User Domain provides authentication and authorization services to all other domains

**Integration Mechanism**: API + Domain Events
- User Domain exposes a well-defined API for authentication and authorization
- User Domain publishes events like `UserCreated` and `UserRoleChanged`
- All domains consume the User Domain API for access control

**Data Exchange**:
- User Domain provides user identity and permissions
- Other domains reference users by ID only

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Implement token-based authentication
- Use role-based access control
- Cache user permissions in each domain

**Potential Conflicts**:
- Different access control requirements across domains
- Performance impact of centralized authentication

**Resolution Strategy**:
- Flexible permission model that can accommodate domain-specific needs
- Performance optimization through caching and asynchronous processing

### 6. Reporting Domain ↔ All Other Domains

**Relationship Type**: Conformist
- Reporting Domain conforms to the models of other domains

**Integration Mechanism**: Domain Events + Read Models
- All domains publish events that the Reporting Domain consumes
- Reporting Domain builds read models optimized for reporting purposes

**Data Exchange**:
- One-way flow of data from other domains to Reporting Domain
- No data flows back from Reporting to other domains

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Implement event sourcing for historical reporting
- Use denormalized read models for performance
- Consider separate reporting database

**Potential Conflicts**:
- Reporting requirements driving changes in domain models
- Performance impact of reporting queries

**Resolution Strategy**:
- Clear separation of operational and reporting concerns
- Dedicated reporting infrastructure
- Asynchronous processing of events for reporting

### 7. Notification Domain ↔ All Other Domains

**Relationship Type**: Conformist
- Notification Domain conforms to the models of other domains

**Integration Mechanism**: Domain Events
- All domains publish events that the Notification Domain consumes
- Notification Domain triggers notifications based on these events

**Data Exchange**:
- One-way flow of event data from other domains to Notification Domain
- No data flows back from Notification to other domains

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Implement notification templates that can adapt to different event structures
- Use a message queue for reliable notification processing
- Implement notification preferences and filtering

**Potential Conflicts**:
- Changes to event structures affecting notification templates
- Volume of notifications impacting system performance

**Resolution Strategy**:
- Flexible notification templates
- Rate limiting and batching for notifications
- Clear event schema documentation

## Integration with External Systems

### ERP System Integration

**Relationship Type**: Anti-Corruption Layer
- Protect domain models from external system concepts

**Integration Mechanism**: Anti-Corruption Layer + Adapters
- Implement adapters for translating between ERP concepts and domain concepts
- Use an anti-corruption layer to isolate domain models from ERP models

**Implementation Considerations**:
- Clearly define the boundary of the anti-corruption layer
- Implement bidirectional translation of concepts
- Consider caching frequently accessed ERP data

**Potential Conflicts**:
- Different data models and business rules
- Synchronization challenges between systems

**Resolution Strategy**:
- Well-defined integration points
- Clear ownership of the anti-corruption layer
- Regular synchronization checks and reconciliation

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Domain Event Implementation

```javascript
// Example domain event structure
{
  "type": "ComponentSpecificationAdded",
  "id": "evt-123456",
  "timestamp": "2023-06-15T14:30:00Z",
  "source": "component-domain",
  "payload": {
    "componentId": "comp-123",
    "specificationId": "spec-456",
    "name": "Max Pressure",
    "value": 5000,
    "unit": "psi",
    "tolerance": 100
  },
  "version": "1.0"
}
```

### 2. API Integration Example

```javascript
// Example of an Open Host Service API endpoint
// User Domain providing authentication service
app.post('/api/auth/login', (req, res) => {
  // Authentication logic
  // Returns a JWT token that other domains can use
});

// Example of how another domain would use this service
async function authenticateUser(credentials) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(credentials),
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  });
  return response.json();
}
```

### 3. Shared Kernel Example

```javascript
// Example of a shared kernel module for specifications
// This would be shared between Component and Inspection domains
class Specification {
  constructor({
    name,
    value,
    unit,
    tolerance = null,
    minValue = null,
    maxValue = null
  }) {
    this.name = name;
    this.value = value;
    this.unit = unit;
    this.tolerance = tolerance;
    this.minValue = minValue;
    this.maxValue = maxValue;
    
    this.validate();
  }
  
  validate() {
    // Validation logic shared by both domains
  }
  
  isWithinTolerance(testValue) {
    // Tolerance checking logic shared by both domains
  }
}

module.exports = Specification;
```

### 4. Anti-Corruption Layer Example

```javascript
// Example of an anti-corruption layer for ERP integration
class ERPSupplierAdapter {
  constructor(erpClient) {
    this.erpClient = erpClient;
  }
  
  async getSupplierFromERP(erpSupplierId) {
    // Get supplier data from ERP
    const erpSupplier = await this.erpClient.getSupplier(erpSupplierId);
    
    // Translate ERP supplier to domain supplier
    return {
      id: `supplier-${erpSupplier.id}`,
      name: erpSupplier.companyName,
      status: this.translateStatus(erpSupplier.status),
      category: this.translateCategory(erpSupplier.type),
      contacts: this.translateContacts(erpSupplier.contactPersons)
    };
  }
  
  translateStatus(erpStatus) {
    // Map ERP status codes to domain status values
    const statusMap = {
      'A': 'active',
      'I': 'inactive',
      'P': 'pending',
      'B': 'blocked'
    };
    return statusMap[erpStatus] || 'unknown';
  }
  
  // Other translation methods...
}
```

## Context Map Evolution

The context map is not static and will evolve as the system and organization evolve. Changes to the context map should be managed carefully:

1. **Documentation**: Keep this context map updated as relationships evolve.

2. **Impact Analysis**: Before changing a relationship, analyze the impact on both domains.

3. **Transition Planning**: Plan for gradual transitions when changing integration patterns.

4. **Communication**: Ensure all teams are aware of changes to the context map.

5. **Versioning**: Version APIs and events to support evolution without breaking existing integrations.

## Governance

To ensure the context map remains effective and up-to-date:

1. **Regular Reviews**: Schedule quarterly reviews of the context map.

2. **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Establish forums for cross-team communication.

3. **Integration Testing**: Implement comprehensive integration tests for all context boundaries.

4. **Monitoring**: Monitor integration points for issues or performance problems.

5. **Documentation**: Maintain up-to-date documentation of all integration patterns and APIs.

## Conclusion

This context mapping document provides a comprehensive view of how the different domains in AeroSuite interact with each other. By clearly defining these relationships and integration patterns, we establish a foundation for effective domain isolation while enabling necessary collaboration between domains. This approach supports the overall goal of creating a modular, maintainable architecture that accurately reflects the business domains.
