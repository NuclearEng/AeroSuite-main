# Context Mapping Documentation

## Introduction

This document provides a detailed context map for the AeroSuite application, defining the
relationships between bounded contexts (domains) and specifying the integration patterns used for
communication between them. Context mapping is a strategic design tool in Domain-Driven Design that
helps visualize and manage the boundaries and interactions between different domains.

## Context Map Overview

The context map illustrates how the various domains in AeroSuite relate to each other and defines
the nature of these relationships. Each relationship follows specific integration patterns that
determine how the domains communicate and share data.

## Domain Relationship Patterns

In DDD, several patterns define how bounded contexts relate to each other. The key patterns used in
AeroSuite are:

1. __Partnership__: Two teams collaborate closely with aligned goals.
2. __Customer-Supplier__: One context provides services to another context.
3. __Conformist__: One context adapts to the model of another context.
4. __Anti-Corruption Layer__: A layer that translates between different models.
5. __Open Host Service__: A context publishes a well-defined API for others to use.
6. __Published Language__: A shared language used for communication between contexts.
7. __Separate Ways__: Contexts decide to have no connection at all.
8. __Shared Kernel__: Contexts share a subset of their domain models.

## Detailed Context Relationships

### 1. Customer Domain ↔ Inspection Domain

__Relationship Type__: Customer-Supplier
- __Upstream__: Customer Domain
- __Downstream__: Inspection Domain

__Integration Mechanism__: Domain Events + Open Host Service
- Customer Domain publishes events like `CustomerCreated` and `CustomerStatusChanged`
- Inspection Domain subscribes to these events to associate inspections with customers
- Inspection Domain provides an API for the Customer Domain to request inspections

__Data Exchange__:
- Customer Domain shares customer information needed for inspections
- Inspection Domain shares inspection results related to specific customers

__Implementation Considerations__:
- Use DTOs (Data Transfer Objects) for data exchange to avoid direct model dependencies
- Implement versioning for APIs to handle evolution of both domains
- Consider caching frequently accessed customer data in the Inspection Domain

__Potential Conflicts__:
- Changes to customer data structure might impact inspection processes
- Different requirements for customer data between domains

__Resolution Strategy__:
- Regular communication between teams
- Clear API contracts with versioning
- Explicit translation layer in Inspection Domain for customer data

### 2. Inspection Domain ↔ Component Domain

__Relationship Type__: Partnership
- Both domains work closely together with aligned goals

__Integration Mechanism__: Shared Kernel + Domain Events
- Both domains share common concepts related to component specifications and inspection criteria
- Component Domain publishes events like `ComponentCreated` and `SpecificationAdded`
- Inspection Domain publishes events like `DefectRecorded` and `InspectionCompleted`

__Shared Kernel Elements__:
- Specification validation rules
- Measurement units and conversions
- Tolerance calculations

__Data Exchange__:
- Component Domain provides specifications and tolerances
- Inspection Domain provides inspection results and defects

__Implementation Considerations__:
- Clearly define and document the shared kernel
- Establish joint governance for changes to shared kernel
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout of changes affecting both domains

__Potential Conflicts__:
- Different interpretations of specification requirements
- Competing priorities for changes to shared concepts

__Resolution Strategy__:
- Joint modeling sessions
- Shared test suite for the shared kernel
- Cross-team code reviews for changes to shared elements

### 3. Component Domain ↔ Supplier Domain

__Relationship Type__: Customer-Supplier
- __Upstream__: Supplier Domain
- __Downstream__: Component Domain

__Integration Mechanism__: Domain Events + Published Language
- Supplier Domain publishes events like `SupplierCreated` and `SupplierQualificationAdded`
- Component Domain subscribes to these events to associate components with suppliers
- Both domains use a published language for supplier capabilities and component requirements

__Published Language Elements__:
- Supplier capability definitions
- Component sourcing requirements
- Qualification criteria

__Data Exchange__:
- Supplier Domain shares supplier capabilities and qualifications
- Component Domain shares component requirements and specifications

__Implementation Considerations__:
- Define the published language as a separate module
- Version the published language explicitly
- Implement translation to/from the published language in both domains

__Potential Conflicts__:
- Different understanding of supplier capabilities
- Changes to qualification criteria affecting component sourcing

__Resolution Strategy__:
- Explicit schema definition for the published language
- Versioning strategy for the published language
- Regular review of the published language by both teams

### 4. Supplier Domain ↔ Customer Domain

__Relationship Type__: Separate Ways
- These domains have minimal direct interaction

__Integration Mechanism__: None (or via other domains)
- Any necessary communication happens through the Inspection Domain
- No direct dependencies between these domains

__Implementation Considerations__:
- Ensure no direct references between these domains
- Use the Inspection Domain as an intermediary when needed

### 5. User Domain ↔ All Other Domains

__Relationship Type__: Open Host Service
- User Domain provides authentication and authorization services to all other domains

__Integration Mechanism__: API + Domain Events
- User Domain exposes a well-defined API for authentication and authorization
- User Domain publishes events like `UserCreated` and `UserRoleChanged`
- All domains consume the User Domain API for access control

__Data Exchange__:
- User Domain provides user identity and permissions
- Other domains reference users by ID only

__Implementation Considerations__:
- Implement token-based authentication
- Use role-based access control
- Cache user permissions in each domain

__Potential Conflicts__:
- Different access control requirements across domains
- Performance impact of centralized authentication

__Resolution Strategy__:
- Flexible permission model that can accommodate domain-specific needs
- Performance optimization through caching and asynchronous processing

### 6. Reporting Domain ↔ All Other Domains

__Relationship Type__: Conformist
- Reporting Domain conforms to the models of other domains

__Integration Mechanism__: Domain Events + Read Models
- All domains publish events that the Reporting Domain consumes
- Reporting Domain builds read models optimized for reporting purposes

__Data Exchange__:
- One-way flow of data from other domains to Reporting Domain
- No data flows back from Reporting to other domains

__Implementation Considerations__:
- Implement event sourcing for historical reporting
- Use denormalized read models for performance
- Consider separate reporting database

__Potential Conflicts__:
- Reporting requirements driving changes in domain models
- Performance impact of reporting queries

__Resolution Strategy__:
- Clear separation of operational and reporting concerns
- Dedicated reporting infrastructure
- Asynchronous processing of events for reporting

### 7. Notification Domain ↔ All Other Domains

__Relationship Type__: Conformist
- Notification Domain conforms to the models of other domains

__Integration Mechanism__: Domain Events
- All domains publish events that the Notification Domain consumes
- Notification Domain triggers notifications based on these events

__Data Exchange__:
- One-way flow of event data from other domains to Notification Domain
- No data flows back from Notification to other domains

__Implementation Considerations__:
- Implement notification templates that can adapt to different event structures
- Use a message queue for reliable notification processing
- Implement notification preferences and filtering

__Potential Conflicts__:
- Changes to event structures affecting notification templates
- Volume of notifications impacting system performance

__Resolution Strategy__:
- Flexible notification templates
- Rate limiting and batching for notifications
- Clear event schema documentation

## Integration with External Systems

### ERP System Integration

__Relationship Type__: Anti-Corruption Layer
- Protect domain models from external system concepts

__Integration Mechanism__: Anti-Corruption Layer + Adapters
- Implement adapters for translating between ERP concepts and domain concepts
- Use an anti-corruption layer to isolate domain models from ERP models

__Implementation Considerations__:
- Clearly define the boundary of the anti-corruption layer
- Implement bidirectional translation of concepts
- Consider caching frequently accessed ERP data

__Potential Conflicts__:
- Different data models and business rules
- Synchronization challenges between systems

__Resolution Strategy__:
- Well-defined integration points
- Clear ownership of the anti-corruption layer
- Regular synchronization checks and reconciliation

## Technical Implementation Guidelines

### 1. Domain Event Implementation

```javascript
// Example domain event structure
{
  "type": "ComponentSpecificationAdded",
  "id": "evt-123456",
  "timestamp": "2023-06-15T14:30:00Z",
  "source": "component-domain",
  "payload": {
    "componentId": "comp-123",
    "specificationId": "spec-456",
    "name": "Max Pressure",
    "value": 5000,
    "unit": "psi",
    "tolerance": 100
  },
  "version": "1.0"
}
```bash

### 2. API Integration Example

```javascript
// Example of an Open Host Service API endpoint
// User Domain providing authentication service
app.post('/api/auth/login', (req, res) => {
  // Authentication logic
  // Returns a JWT token that other domains can use
});

// Example of how another domain would use this service
async function authenticateUser(credentials) {
  const response = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify(credentials),
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' }
  });
  return response.json();
}
```bash

### 3. Shared Kernel Example

```javascript
// Example of a shared kernel module for specifications
// This would be shared between Component and Inspection domains
class Specification {
  constructor({
    name,
    value,
    unit,
    tolerance = null,
    minValue = null,
    maxValue = null
  }) {
    this.name = name;
    this.value = value;
    this.unit = unit;
    this.tolerance = tolerance;
    this.minValue = minValue;
    this.maxValue = maxValue;

    this.validate();
  }

  validate() {
    // Validation logic shared by both domains
  }

  isWithinTolerance(testValue) {
    // Tolerance checking logic shared by both domains
  }
}

module.exports = Specification;
```bash

### 4. Anti-Corruption Layer Example

```javascript
// Example of an anti-corruption layer for ERP integration
class ERPSupplierAdapter {
  constructor(erpClient) {
    this.erpClient = erpClient;
  }

  async getSupplierFromERP(erpSupplierId) {
    // Get supplier data from ERP
    const erpSupplier = await this.erpClient.getSupplier(erpSupplierId);

    // Translate ERP supplier to domain supplier
    return {
      id: `supplier-${erpSupplier.id}`,
      name: erpSupplier.companyName,
      status: this.translateStatus(erpSupplier.status),
      category: this.translateCategory(erpSupplier.type),
      contacts: this.translateContacts(erpSupplier.contactPersons)
    };
  }

  translateStatus(erpStatus) {
    // Map ERP status codes to domain status values
    const statusMap = {
      'A': 'active',
      'I': 'inactive',
      'P': 'pending',
      'B': 'blocked'
    };
    return statusMap[erpStatus] || 'unknown';
  }

  // Other translation methods...
}
```bash

## Context Map Evolution

The context map is not static and will evolve as the system and organization evolve. Changes to the
context map should be managed carefully:

1. __Documentation__: Keep this context map updated as relationships evolve.

2. __Impact Analysis__: Before changing a relationship, analyze the impact on both domains.

3. __Transition Planning__: Plan for gradual transitions when changing integration patterns.

4. __Communication__: Ensure all teams are aware of changes to the context map.

5. __Versioning__: Version APIs and events to support evolution without breaking existing
integrations.

## Governance

To ensure the context map remains effective and up-to-date:

1. __Regular Reviews__: Schedule quarterly reviews of the context map.

2. __Cross-Team Collaboration__: Establish forums for cross-team communication.

3. __Integration Testing__: Implement comprehensive integration tests for all context boundaries.

4. __Monitoring__: Monitor integration points for issues or performance problems.

5. __Documentation__: Maintain up-to-date documentation of all integration patterns and APIs.

## Conclusion

This context mapping document provides a comprehensive view of how the different domains in
AeroSuite interact with each other. By clearly defining these relationships and integration
patterns, we establish a foundation for effective domain isolation while enabling necessary
collaboration between domains. This approach supports the overall goal of creating a modular,
maintainable architecture that accurately reflects the business domains.
