# Context Integration Strategy

## Introduction

This document outlines the implementation strategy for integrating the different bounded contexts
(domains) in the AeroSuite application. It provides practical guidance on how to implement the
integration patterns defined in the context map, focusing on technical approaches, tools, and best
practices.

## Integration Principles

1. __Loose Coupling__: Domains should be loosely coupled, with minimal direct dependencies.
2. __Clear Contracts__: All integration points should have clear, well-defined contracts.
3. __Resilience__: Integration should be resilient to failures in other domains.
4. __Versioning__: All APIs and events should be versioned to support evolution.
5. __Observability__: All integration points should be monitored and logged.

## Domain Event System

### Implementation Approach

We will implement a domain event system using a message broker to enable asynchronous communication
between domains. This approach supports loose coupling while allowing domains to react to events
from other domains.

### Technical Components

1. __Message Broker__: RabbitMQ for reliable message delivery
2. __Event Schema Registry__: JSON Schema for event validation
3. __Event Publisher__: Library for publishing events to the message broker
4. __Event Subscriber__: Library for subscribing to events from the message broker
5. __Dead Letter Queue__: For handling failed event processing

### Event Flow

```bash
+----------------+        +----------------+        +----------------+
|                |        |                |        |                |
|  Publisher     |------->|  Message       |------->|  Subscriber    |
|  Domain        |        |  Broker        |        |  Domain        |
|                |        |                |        |                |
+----------------+        +----------------+        +----------------+
                                  |
                                  |
                                  v
                          +----------------+
                          |                |
                          |  Schema        |
                          |  Registry      |
                          |                |
                          +----------------+
```bash

2. Create event schema registry
3. Implement event publisher library
4. Implement event subscriber library
5. Configure dead letter queues
6. Implement event serialization/deserialization
7. Add monitoring and logging

## API Integration

### Implementation Approach

For synchronous communication between domains, we will implement RESTful APIs with clear contracts.
This approach is used primarily for the Open Host Service pattern.

### Technical Components

1. __API Gateway__: For routing and authentication
2. __API Documentation__: OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation
3. __API Versioning__: URL-based versioning (e.g., /v1/resource)
4. __Authentication__: JWT-based authentication
5. __Rate Limiting__: To prevent abuse

### API Architecture

```bash
+----------------+        +----------------+        +----------------+
|                |        |                |        |                |
|  Client        |------->|  API           |------->|  Service       |
|  Domain        |        |  Gateway       |        |  Domain        |
|                |        |                |        |                |
+----------------+        +----------------+        +----------------+
                                  |
                                  |
                                  v
                          +----------------+
                          |                |
                          |  Auth          |
                          |  Service       |
                          |                |

|  Supplier      |------->|  Published     |------->|  Component     |
|  Domain        |        |  Language      |        |  Domain        |
|                |        |                |        |                |

AeroSuite. By following these guidelines, we can ensure that domains remain properly isolated while
still enabling necessary communication between them. This approach supports the overall goal of
creating a modular, maintainable architecture that accurately reflects the business domains.
