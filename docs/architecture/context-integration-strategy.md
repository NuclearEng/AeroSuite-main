# Context Integration Strategy

## Introduction

This document outlines the implementation strategy for integrating the different bounded contexts (domains) in the AeroSuite application. It provides practical guidance on how to implement the integration patterns defined in the context map, focusing on technical approaches, tools, and best practices.

## Integration Principles

1. **Loose Coupling**: Domains should be loosely coupled, with minimal direct dependencies.
2. **Clear Contracts**: All integration points should have clear, well-defined contracts.
3. **Resilience**: Integration should be resilient to failures in other domains.
4. **Versioning**: All APIs and events should be versioned to support evolution.
5. **Observability**: All integration points should be monitored and logged.

## Domain Event System

### Implementation Approach

We will implement a domain event system using a message broker to enable asynchronous communication between domains. This approach supports loose coupling while allowing domains to react to events from other domains.

### Technical Components

1. **Message Broker**: RabbitMQ for reliable message delivery
2. **Event Schema Registry**: JSON Schema for event validation
3. **Event Publisher**: Library for publishing events to the message broker
4. **Event Subscriber**: Library for subscribing to events from the message broker
5. **Dead Letter Queue**: For handling failed event processing

### Event Flow

```
+----------------+        +----------------+        +----------------+
|                |        |                |        |                |
|  Publisher     |------->|  Message       |------->|  Subscriber    |
|  Domain        |        |  Broker        |        |  Domain        |
|                |        |                |        |                |
+----------------+        +----------------+        +----------------+
                                  |
                                  |
                                  v
                          +----------------+
                          |                |
                          |  Schema        |
                          |  Registry      |
                          |                |
                          +----------------+
```

## API Integration

### Implementation Approach

For synchronous communication between domains, we will implement RESTful APIs with clear contracts. This approach is used primarily for the Open Host Service pattern.

### Technical Components

1. **API Gateway**: For routing and authentication
2. **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger for API documentation
3. **API Versioning**: URL-based versioning (e.g., /v1/resource)
4. **Authentication**: JWT-based authentication
5. **Rate Limiting**: To prevent abuse

### API Architecture

+----------------+        +----------------+        +----------------+
                                  |
                                  |

                          +----------------+
                          |                |
                          |  Auth          |
                          |  Service       |
                          |                |
