## Introduction

AeroSuite uses a multi-tier load balancing approach to ensure high availability, optimal resource utilization, and fault tolerance. The implementation combines Kubernetes-native load balancing with NGINX as an application-level load balancer, providing advanced traffic management capabilities.

## Load Balancing Strategies

### 1. Session Persistence (Sticky Sessions)

**Implementation**: IP Hash
**Used for**: API servers
**Configuration**: `ip_hash` directive in NGINX upstream configuration

The IP hash strategy ensures that requests from the same client IP address are consistently routed to the same backend server, maintaining session state without requiring shared session storage.

```nginx
upstream api_servers {
    ip_hash;
    # Server definitions...
}
```

### 2. Least Connections

**Implementation**: `least_conn` directive
**Used for**: Frontend servers
**Configuration**: NGINX upstream configuration

Routes requests to the server with the fewest active connections, ensuring optimal distribution of load across frontend instances.

```nginx
upstream frontend_servers {
    least_conn;
    # Server definitions...
}
```

### 3. Weighted Round-Robin

**Implementation**: Server weight attributes
**Used for**: High-traffic API endpoints
**Configuration**: Weight attributes in server definitions

Distributes traffic proportionally based on server weights, allowing for more powerful servers to handle more requests.

```nginx
upstream api_high_traffic {
    server server1 weight=3;
    server server2 weight=2;
    # Additional servers...
}
```

### 4. Least Time

**Implementation**: `least_time` directive
**Used for**: Read-only API endpoints
**Configuration**: NGINX upstream configuration

Routes requests to the server with the lowest average response time, optimizing for performance-critical endpoints.

```nginx
upstream api_read_only {
    least_time header;
    # Server definitions...
}
```

### 5. A/B Testing Support

**Implementation**: Split clients and conditional routing
**Used for**: Frontend application
**Configuration**: NGINX split_clients directive

Enables A/B testing by routing a percentage of users to different application versions.

```nginx
split_clients "${remote_addr}${http_user_agent}" $variant {
    20%     "A";
    20%     "B";
    *       "";
}
```

### 6. Geo-Based Routing

**Implementation**: NGINX geo directive
**Used for**: Regional traffic management
**Configuration**: NGINX geo directive

Routes traffic differently based on client IP address ranges, allowing for region-specific optimizations.

```nginx
geo $remote_addr $geo_region {
    default         "global";
    10.0.0.0/8      "internal";
    192.168.0.0/16  "internal";
}
```

## Implementation Details

### NGINX Configuration

The advanced load balancing implementation uses NGINX as the primary load balancer with the following components:

1. **Upstream Definitions**: Configured in `upstreams.conf`
2. **Server Blocks**: Configured in `default.conf`
3. **Rate Limiting**: Applied at different levels for different endpoints
4. **Connection Pooling**: Keepalive connections to backend servers
5. **Health Checks**: Active health monitoring of backend servers
6. **Caching**: Tiered caching strategy for static content and API responses

### Kubernetes Integration

The load balancing strategy is integrated with Kubernetes using:

1. **External Load Balancer**: Exposed via Kubernetes LoadBalancer service
2. **ConfigMaps**: NGINX configuration stored in ConfigMaps
3. **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler**: Automatic scaling of NGINX instances
4. **Pod Disruption Budget**: Ensures minimum availability during maintenance
5. **Readiness/Liveness Probes**: Ensures only healthy instances receive traffic

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

The load balancing configuration is defined in the following files:

- `nginx/conf.d/upstreams.conf`: Defines upstream server groups and load balancing methods
- `nginx/conf.d/default.conf`: Configures server blocks, locations, and routing rules
- `k8s/base/advanced-load-balancing.yaml`: Kubernetes resources for deploying the load balancer

### Environment-Specific Configuration

Environment-specific configurations are managed through Kubernetes overlays:

- `k8s/overlays/dev/`: Development environment configuration
- `k8s/overlays/prod/`: Production environment configuration

### Applying Configuration

To apply the load balancing configuration:

```bash
# Apply the configuration to the current Kubernetes context
./k8s/scripts/apply-load-balancing.sh
```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Monitoring Metrics

The following metrics should be monitored to ensure optimal load balancing:

1. **Request Distribution**: Verify even distribution across backend servers
2. **Response Times**: Monitor response times by server and endpoint
3. **Error Rates**: Track error rates by server and endpoint
4. **Connection Counts**: Monitor active and idle connections
5. **Cache Hit Rates**: Track cache effectiveness

### Health Checks

Health checks are implemented at multiple levels:

1. **NGINX Level**: Active health checks to backend servers
2. **Kubernetes Level**: Readiness and liveness probes
3. **Application Level**: `/health` and `/lb-health` endpoints

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Testing**: Conduct regular load tests to verify load balancing effectiveness
2. **Gradual Scaling**: Use slow_start to gradually introduce new servers
3. **Backup Servers**: Designate backup servers for failover scenarios
4. **Connection Limits**: Implement connection limits to prevent resource exhaustion
5. **Cache Tuning**: Regularly review and tune cache settings based on traffic patterns
6. **SSL Termination**: Terminate SSL at the load balancer level when possible
7. **Header Propagation**: Ensure proper header propagation for client information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Uneven Load Distribution**
   - Check server weights
   - Verify health check configurations
   - Review connection settings

2. **Session Persistence Issues**
   - Verify ip_hash configuration
   - Check for proxy servers in the request path
   - Review client IP extraction settings

3. **High Latency**
   - Check backend server performance
   - Review keepalive settings
   - Analyze network connectivity between load balancer and backends

4. **Cache Issues**
   - Verify cache path permissions
   - Check cache key configuration
   - Review cache invalidation settings

### Debugging Tools

1. **NGINX Status Page**: Enable and use the NGINX status page
2. **Access Logs**: Configure detailed access logs with timing information
3. **Headers**: Use X-Cache-Status and custom headers for debugging
4. **Kubernetes Tools**: Use kubectl describe and logs for Kubernetes-level debugging
