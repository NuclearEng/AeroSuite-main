## Introduction

AeroSuite uses a multi-tier load balancing approach to ensure high availability, optimal resource
utilization, and fault tolerance. The implementation combines Kubernetes-native load balancing with
NGINX as an application-level load balancer, providing advanced traffic management capabilities.

## Load Balancing Strategies

### 1. Session Persistence (Sticky Sessions)

__Implementation__: IP Hash
__Used for__: API servers
__Configuration__: `ip_hash` directive in NGINX upstream configuration

The IP hash strategy ensures that requests from the same client IP address are consistently routed
to the same backend server, maintaining session state without requiring shared session storage.

```nginx
upstream api_servers {
    ip_hash;
    # Server definitions...
}
```bash

### 2. Least Connections

__Implementation__: `least_conn` directive
__Used for__: Frontend servers
__Configuration__: NGINX upstream configuration

Routes requests to the server with the fewest active connections, ensuring optimal distribution of
load across frontend instances.

```nginx
upstream frontend_servers {
    least_conn;
    # Server definitions...
}
```bash

### 3. Weighted Round-Robin

__Implementation__: Server weight attributes
__Used for__: High-traffic API endpoints
__Configuration__: Weight attributes in server definitions

Distributes traffic proportionally based on server weights, allowing for more powerful servers to
handle more requests.

```nginx
upstream api_high_traffic {
    server server1 weight=3;
    server server2 weight=2;
    # Additional servers...
}
```bash

### 4. Least Time

__Implementation__: `least_time` directive
__Used for__: Read-only API endpoints
__Configuration__: NGINX upstream configuration

Routes requests to the server with the lowest average response time, optimizing for
performance-critical endpoints.

```nginx
upstream api_read_only {
    least_time header;
    # Server definitions...
}
```bash

### 5. A/B Testing Support

__Implementation__: Split clients and conditional routing
__Used for__: Frontend application
__Configuration__: NGINX split_clients directive

Enables A/B testing by routing a percentage of users to different application versions.

```nginx
split_clients "${remote_addr}${http_user_agent}" $variant {
    20%     "A";
    20%     "B";
    *       "";
}
```bash

### 6. Geo-Based Routing

__Implementation__: NGINX geo directive
__Used for__: Regional traffic management
__Configuration__: NGINX geo directive

Routes traffic differently based on client IP address ranges, allowing for region-specific
optimizations.

```nginx
geo $remote_addr $geo_region {
    default         "global";
    10.0.0.0/8      "internal";
    192.168.0.0/16  "internal";
}
```bash

## Implementation Details

### NGINX Configuration

The advanced load balancing implementation uses NGINX as the primary load balancer with the
following components:

1. __Upstream Definitions__: Configured in `upstreams.conf`
2. __Server Blocks__: Configured in `default.conf`
3. __Rate Limiting__: Applied at different levels for different endpoints
4. __Connection Pooling__: Keepalive connections to backend servers
5. __Health Checks__: Active health monitoring of backend servers
6. __Caching__: Tiered caching strategy for static content and API responses

### Kubernetes Integration

The load balancing strategy is integrated with Kubernetes using:

1. __External Load Balancer__: Exposed via Kubernetes LoadBalancer service
2. __ConfigMaps__: NGINX configuration stored in ConfigMaps
3. __Horizontal Pod Autoscaler__: Automatic scaling of NGINX instances
4. __Pod Disruption Budget__: Ensures minimum availability during maintenance
5. __Readiness/Liveness Probes__: Ensures only healthy instances receive traffic

## Configuration

### Basic Configuration

The load balancing configuration is defined in the following files:

- `nginx/conf.d/upstreams.conf`: Defines upstream server groups and load balancing methods
- `nginx/conf.d/default.conf`: Configures server blocks, locations, and routing rules
- `k8s/base/advanced-load-balancing.yaml`: Kubernetes resources for deploying the load balancer

### Environment-Specific Configuration

Environment-specific configurations are managed through Kubernetes overlays:

- `k8s/overlays/dev/`: Development environment configuration
- `k8s/overlays/prod/`: Production environment configuration

### Applying Configuration

To apply the load balancing configuration:

```bash
# Apply the configuration to the current Kubernetes context
./k8s/scripts/apply-load-balancing.sh
```bash

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Monitoring Metrics

The following metrics should be monitored to ensure optimal load balancing:

1. __Request Distribution__: Verify even distribution across backend servers
2. __Response Times__: Monitor response times by server and endpoint
3. __Error Rates__: Track error rates by server and endpoint
4. __Connection Counts__: Monitor active and idle connections
5. __Cache Hit Rates__: Track cache effectiveness

### Health Checks

Health checks are implemented at multiple levels:

1. __NGINX Level__: Active health checks to backend servers
2. __Kubernetes Level__: Readiness and liveness probes
3. __Application Level__: `/health` and `/lb-health` endpoints

## Best Practices

1. __Regular Testing__: Conduct regular load tests to verify load balancing effectiveness
2. __Gradual Scaling__: Use slow_start to gradually introduce new servers
3. __Backup Servers__: Designate backup servers for failover scenarios
4. __Connection Limits__: Implement connection limits to prevent resource exhaustion
5. __Cache Tuning__: Regularly review and tune cache settings based on traffic patterns
6. __SSL Termination__: Terminate SSL at the load balancer level when possible
7. __Header Propagation__: Ensure proper header propagation for client information

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. __Uneven Load Distribution__
   - Check server weights
   - Verify health check configurations
   - Review connection settings

2. __Session Persistence Issues__
   - Verify ip_hash configuration
   - Check for proxy servers in the request path
   - Review client IP extraction settings

3. __High Latency__
   - Check backend server performance
   - Review keepalive settings
   - Analyze network connectivity between load balancer and backends

4. __Cache Issues__
   - Verify cache path permissions
   - Check cache key configuration
   - Review cache invalidation settings

### Debugging Tools

1. __NGINX Status Page__: Enable and use the NGINX status page
2. __Access Logs__: Configure detailed access logs with timing information
3. __Headers__: Use X-Cache-Status and custom headers for debugging
4. __Kubernetes Tools__: Use kubectl describe and logs for Kubernetes-level debugging
