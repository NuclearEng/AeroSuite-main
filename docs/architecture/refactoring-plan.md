# AeroSuite Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step plan to refactor the AeroSuite codebase to achieve a best-in-class architecture.

## Phase 1: Domain-Driven Design Implementation

### 1.1 Domain Boundary Definition (2 weeks)

- [ ] Conduct domain analysis workshops with stakeholders
- [ ] Define bounded contexts and ubiquitous language for each domain
- [ ] Document domain relationships and context maps
- [ ] Create domain models with clear aggregates and entities

### 1.2 Code Reorganization (3 weeks)

- [ ] Restructure server code into domain-focused directories
- [ ] Implement domain service interfaces
- [ ] Extract shared kernel for common functionality
- [ ] Create anti-corruption layers between domains

### 1.3 Data Access Refactoring (2 weeks)

- [ ] Implement repository pattern for each domain
- [ ] Optimize database queries and indexing
- [ ] Add data validation at domain boundaries
- [ ] Implement domain events for cross-domain communication

## Phase 2: Component Decomposition

### 2.1 Frontend Component Refactoring (3 weeks)

- [ ] Break down large components (>500 LOC) into smaller, focused ones
- [ ] Implement component composition patterns
- [ ] Create reusable UI component library
- [ ] Add comprehensive component documentation

### 2.2 API Layer Refactoring (2 weeks)

- [ ] Standardize API contracts
- [ ] Implement versioned APIs
- [ ] Add comprehensive API documentation
- [ ] Implement consistent error handling

### 2.3 Service Layer Refactoring (3 weeks)

- [ ] Extract business logic into domain services
- [ ] Implement service interfaces for dependency inversion
- [ ] Add comprehensive unit tests for services
- [ ] Implement service discovery for future microservices

## Phase 3: Performance Optimization

### 3.1 Caching Implementation (2 weeks)

- [ ] Implement multi-level caching strategy
- [ ] Add Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- [ ] Implement cache invalidation patterns
- [ ] Add cache monitoring and metrics

### 3.2 Database Optimization (2 weeks)

- [ ] Review and optimize database schema
- [ ] Add missing indexes
- [ ] Implement query optimization
- [ ] Set up database monitoring

### 3.3 Frontend Performance (2 weeks)

- [ ] Implement code splitting
- [ ] Add lazy loading for routes and components
- [ ] Optimize bundle size
- [ ] Implement progressive loading strategies

## Phase 4: Scalability Enhancements

### 4.1 Horizontal Scaling (2 weeks)

- [ ] Ensure all services are stateless
- [ ] Implement distributed session management
- [ ] Configure auto-scaling for all services
- [ ] Test scaling under load

### 4.2 Load Balancing (1 week)

- [ ] Configure advanced load balancing strategies
- [ ] Implement health checks for all services
- [ ] Add circuit breakers for resilience
- [ ] Configure rate limiting

### 4.3 Monitoring and Observability (2 weeks)

- [ ] Implement comprehensive logging
- [ ] Add distributed tracing
- [ ] Set up metrics collection
- [ ] Create monitoring dashboards

## Phase 5: AI/ML Infrastructure

### 5.1 ML Service Architecture (3 weeks)

- [ ] Set up ML service infrastructure
- [ ] Implement model serving endpoints
- [ ] Create feature engineering pipeline
- [ ] Add model registry

### 5.2 Model Training Pipeline (3 weeks)

- [ ] Set up containerized training environments
- [ ] Implement experiment tracking
- [ ] Add automated model evaluation
- [ ] Create CI/CD pipeline for models

### 5.3 Model Monitoring (2 weeks)

- [ ] Implement performance metrics tracking
- [ ] Add data drift detection
- [ ] Set up automated retraining triggers
- [ ] Create model performance dashboards

## Implementation Strategy

### Team Organization

- **Core Architecture Team**: Focus on domain boundaries and shared infrastructure
- **Domain Teams**: Responsible for specific bounded contexts
- **DevOps Team**: Handle infrastructure and deployment concerns
- **ML Engineering Team**: Focus on AI/ML infrastructure

### Prioritization Criteria

1. **Business Impact**: Focus on high-value domains first
2. **Technical Risk**: Address high-risk areas early
3. **Dependencies**: Resolve foundational issues before dependent ones
4. **Team Capacity**: Balance work across teams

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all domain services and models
- Integration tests for domain boundaries
- End-to-end tests for critical user journeys
- Performance tests for key operations

## Success Metrics

- **Code Quality**: >90% test coverage for domain services
- **Performance**: <200ms response time for 95% of API requests
- **Scalability**: Support 10x current user load with linear resource scaling
- **Maintainability**: Reduced time to implement new features by 30%
- **Developer Experience**: Improved onboarding time for new developers by 50%

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Business disruption during refactoring | High | Medium | Incremental approach with feature flags |
| Knowledge gaps in DDD implementation | Medium | High | Training sessions and external expertise |
| Performance regression | High | Medium | Comprehensive performance testing |
| Timeline slippage | Medium | High | Regular progress reviews and adjustments |
| Team resistance to changes | Medium | Medium | Clear communication and involvement |
