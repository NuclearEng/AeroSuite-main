# OWASP Top 10 Compliance Audit

This document describes the OWASP Top 10 compliance audit implementation for AeroSuite, which
systematically tests the application against each of the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities.

## Overview

The OWASP Top 10 compliance audit is a comprehensive security assessment that evaluates AeroSuite's
protection against the most critical web application security risks as defined by the Open Web
Application Security Project (OWASP).

The audit covers all aspects of the application, including:

- API endpoints
- Authentication mechanisms
- Authorization controls
- Data validation and sanitization
- Cryptographic implementations
- Infrastructure configuration
- Logging and monitoring
- And more

## OWASP Top 10 Categories (2021)

The audit checks compliance against the following OWASP Top 10 categories:

1. __A01:2021 – Broken Access Control__
   - Testing for unauthorized access to resources
   - Checking privilege escalation vulnerabilities
   - Validating API access controls

2. __A02:2021 – Cryptographic Failures__
   - Verifying HTTPS implementation
   - Checking sensitive data transmission
   - Validating storage of sensitive information

3. __A03:2021 – Injection__
   - Testing for SQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Testing for NoSQL injection vulnerabilities
   - Checking for cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
   - Validating command injection protection

4. __A04:2021 – Insecure Design__
   - Analyzing business logic flaws
   - Checking rate limiting implementations
   - Evaluating data validation processes

5. __A05:2021 – Security Misconfiguration__
   - Checking for default credentials
   - Validating security headers
   - Testing for unnecessary exposed features

6. __A06:2021 – Vulnerable and Outdated Components__
   - Scanning dependencies for known vulnerabilities
   - Checking for outdated frameworks and libraries
   - Validating update processes

7. __A07:2021 – Identification and Authentication Failures__
   - Testing password policies
   - Checking brute force protection
   - Validating session management

8. __A08:2021 – Software and Data Integrity Failures__
   - Checking for insecure deserialization
   - Validating dependency integrity
   - Testing CI/CD security controls

9. __A09:2021 – Security Logging and Monitoring Failures__
   - Validating logging implementation
   - Checking audit logging
   - Testing alerting mechanisms

10. __A10:2021 – Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)__
    - Testing URL validation
    - Checking server-side request controls
    - Validating network segmentation

## Audit Implementation

The OWASP Top 10 compliance audit is implemented through a comprehensive script that automates the
testing process. The script:

1. Systematically tests the application against each OWASP category
2. Generates a detailed report of findings
3. Calculates a compliance score for each category
4. Provides remediation recommendations for identified vulnerabilities

## Running the Audit

The audit can be run using the following npm commands:

```bash
# Run a standard OWASP Top 10 audit
npm run owasp:audit

# Run an audit with detailed HTML report generation
npm run owasp:audit:html
```bash

### Command Line Options

The audit script supports various command line options:

- `--target <url>`: Target application base URL (default: http://localhost:3000)
- `--api <url>`: Target API base URL (default: http://localhost:5000)
- `--output <file>`: Output file for the report (default: security-reports/owasp-audit-report.json)
- `--html`: Generate an HTML report in addition to JSON
- `--auth <token>`: Authorization token for authenticated requests
- `--verbose`: Enable verbose output
- `--category <cat>`: Run tests for a specific category only (e.g., A01, A02, etc.)

## Audit Reports

The audit generates comprehensive reports in both JSON and HTML formats (when the `--html` flag is
used). The reports include:

- Overall compliance score
- Category-specific compliance scores
- Detailed test results for each vulnerability check
- Specific vulnerabilities found with severity ratings
- Remediation recommendations

## Integration with CI/CD

The OWASP Top 10 compliance audit can be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to ensure continuous
security validation:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow step
- name: Run OWASP Top 10 Audit
  run: npm run owasp:audit

- name: Check Audit Results
  run: node scripts/check-owasp-audit-results.js --min-score 80
```bash

## Regular Audit Schedule

To maintain ongoing security compliance, it is recommended to run the OWASP Top 10 audit:

1. After major application changes
2. At least once per quarter
3. Before major releases
4. When new vulnerabilities are discovered in used components
