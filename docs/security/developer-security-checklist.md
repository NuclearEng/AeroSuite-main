# AeroSuite Developer Security Checklist

This checklist provides a quick reference for developers to ensure they are following security best practices while working on the AeroSuite project. Use this checklist during development, code review, and testing phases.

## Authentication & Authorization

- [ ] All endpoints require proper authentication
- [ ] Authorization checks are implemented for all sensitive operations
- [ ] JWT tokens are properly validated (signature, expiration, issuer)
- [ ] Password reset functionality follows secure practices
- [ ] Session timeout and inactivity logout are implemented
- [ ] No sensitive data is stored in JWT payload

## Input Validation & Output Encoding

- [ ] All user inputs are validated on the server side
- [ ] Input validation includes type, length, format, and range checks
- [ ] Parameterized queries are used for all database operations
- [ ] Output is encoded appropriately for the context (HTML, JavaScript, CSS, URL)
- [ ] Content Security Policy is implemented and tested
- [ ] File uploads are validated for type, size, and content

## Data Protection

- [ ] Sensitive data is encrypted at rest
- [ ] Sensitive data is encrypted in transit (HTTPS)
- [ ] No sensitive data is logged or exposed in error messages
- [ ] No sensitive data is stored in client-side storage (localStorage, sessionStorage)
- [ ] Data is redacted in logs and error reports
- [ ] PII handling follows data protection regulations

## API Security

- [ ] API endpoints follow RESTful security best practices
- [ ] Rate limiting is implemented for all endpoints
- [ ] CORS is properly configured with appropriate origins
- [ ] Security headers are set correctly
- [ ] Error responses don't leak sensitive information
- [ ] API versioning strategy is followed

## Frontend Security

- [ ] No sensitive data is exposed in client-side code
- [ ] XSS protections are in place
- [ ] CSRF protections are implemented for state-changing operations
- [ ] Third-party libraries are from trusted sources and up to date
- [ ] Client-side validation is supplemented with server-side validation
- [ ] UI permissions are consistent with backend permissions

## Secure Coding

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets or credentials in code
- [ ] Secure random number generation for sensitive operations
- [ ] No use of deprecated or insecure functions
- [ ] Proper error handling without information leakage
- [ ] Defense in depth approach (multiple layers of security)
- [ ] Code follows the principle of least privilege

## Dependency Management

- [ ] All dependencies are up to date
- [ ] Dependencies are scanned for known vulnerabilities
- [ ] Unused dependencies are removed
- [ ] Dependency sources are verified and trusted
- [ ] Dependency integrity is verified (checksums, signatures)
- [ ] Transitive dependencies are also checked for vulnerabilities

## Testing

- [ ] Security unit tests are implemented
- [ ] Authentication and authorization tests are in place
- [ ] Boundary testing for input validation
- [ ] Security scanning is part of the CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Penetration testing findings are addressed
- [ ] Security regression tests are maintained

## Logging & Monitoring

- [ ] Security-relevant events are logged
- [ ] Logs include necessary context without sensitive data
- [ ] Log integrity is maintained
- [ ] Logging follows a consistent format
- [ ] Logs can be correlated across services
- [ ] Monitoring alerts for suspicious activities

## Deployment

- [ ] Production builds remove debug information
- [ ] Secrets are managed securely in production
- [ ] Deployment follows the principle of least privilege
- [ ] Container images are scanned for vulnerabilities
- [ ] Infrastructure as code is security reviewed
- [ ] Rollback procedures are tested

## Code Review

- [ ] Security-focused code reviews are conducted
- [ ] OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities are checked
- [ ] Business logic vulnerabilities are considered
- [ ] Security requirements are verified
- [ ] Previous security issues are not reintroduced
- [ ] Security debt is documented and addressed

## Documentation

- [ ] Security features are properly documented
- [ ] Security assumptions are documented
- [ ] Integration points document security requirements
- [ ] Security configurations are documented
- [ ] Security trade-offs are explained
- [ ] Security testing procedures are documented

## Incident Response

- [ ] Security contact information is available
- [ ] Vulnerability reporting process is understood
- [ ] Developers know how to report security issues
- [ ] Security issue severity classification is understood
- [ ] Response time expectations are documented
- [ ] Post-incident review process is in place
