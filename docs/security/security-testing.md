# AeroSuite Security Testing

This document outlines the security testing approach for the AeroSuite application and provides guidance on running security tests.

## Security Testing Approach

AeroSuite implements a multi-layered approach to security testing:

1. **Automated Security Scanning**: Regular automated security scans to detect common vulnerabilities.
2. **Dependency Vulnerability Analysis**: Monitoring dependencies for known security issues.
3. **Code Analysis**: Detecting insecure coding patterns and potential vulnerabilities.
4. **Configuration Analysis**: Evaluating the security of application configurations.
5. **API Security Testing**: Validating that API endpoints implement proper security controls.

## Running Security Tests

AeroSuite includes a security testing script that can be used to perform automated security assessments of the application.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14+
- npm or yarn
- Access to the AeroSuite codebase

### Basic Usage

To run a basic security scan:

```bash
node scripts/security-test.js
```

By default, this will run a quick security scan and output the results to `security-report.json`.

### Options

The security testing script supports several options:

- `--full`: Run a comprehensive security scan (slower but more thorough)
- `--quick`: Run a quick security scan (default)
- `--api-only`: Only test API endpoints
- `--report-file <file>`: Output report to the specified file

Example:

```bash
node scripts/security-test.js --full --report-file security-reports/full-scan-2023-07-15.json
```

### Interpreting Results

The security scan produces a JSON report with the following structure:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-07-15T12:34:56.789Z",
  "summary": {
    "criticalVulnerabilities": 0,
    "highVulnerabilities": 1,
    "mediumVulnerabilities": 2,
    "lowVulnerabilities": 3,
    "infoFindings": 1
  },
  "riskScore": 25,
  "riskLevel": "Medium",
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "SEC-1",
      "severity": "high",
      "title": "Hardcoded API key",
      "description": "Found possible hardcoded API key in code",
      "location": "./src/services/externalApi.js",
      "remediation": "Remove sensitive information from code and use environment variables instead"
    },
    // Additional findings...
  ]
}
```

Each finding includes:
- **ID**: Unique identifier for the finding
- **Severity**: Critical, high, medium, low, or info
- **Title**: Brief description of the issue
- **Description**: Detailed explanation of the vulnerability
- **Location**: File or component where the issue was found
- **Remediation**: Recommended steps to fix the issue

### Risk Score

The security scan calculates a risk score from 0-100 based on the number and severity of findings:
- 0: No vulnerabilities
- 1-24: Low risk
- 25-49: Medium risk
- 50-74: High risk
- 75-100: Critical risk

## Continuous Security Testing

It's recommended to run security tests:
- As part of the CI/CD pipeline
- Before major releases
- After adding new dependencies
- After implementing significant new features

## Manual Security Testing

In addition to automated security testing, consider performing manual security testing:

1. **Penetration Testing**: Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the application
2. **Code Reviews**: Manual inspection of code for security issues
3. **Authentication Testing**: Verify that authentication mechanisms work as expected
4. **Authorization Testing**: Ensure proper access controls are in place
5. **Input Validation Testing**: Test how the application handles malicious input

## Security Testing Best Practices

1. **Regular Testing**: Run security tests regularly, not just when security issues are suspected
2. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Test all aspects of the application, not just the obvious entry points
3. **Realistic Testing**: Use realistic test data and scenarios
4. **Track Progress**: Monitor security improvements over time
5. **Remediate Issues**: Address security issues in a timely manner based on severity
