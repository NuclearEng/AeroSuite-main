# AeroSuite Security Testing

This document outlines the security testing approach for the AeroSuite application and provides
guidance on running security tests.

## Security Testing Approach

AeroSuite implements a multi-layered approach to security testing:

1. __Automated Security Scanning__: Regular automated security scans to detect common
vulnerabilities.
2. __Dependency Vulnerability Analysis__: Monitoring dependencies for known security issues.
3. __Code Analysis__: Detecting insecure coding patterns and potential vulnerabilities.
4. __Configuration Analysis__: Evaluating the security of application configurations.
5. __API Security Testing__: Validating that API endpoints implement proper security controls.

## Running Security Tests

AeroSuite includes a security testing script that can be used to perform automated security
assessments of the application.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 14+
- npm or yarn
- Access to the AeroSuite codebase

### Basic Usage

To run a basic security scan:

```bash
node scripts/security-test.js
```bash

By default, this will run a quick security scan and output the results to `security-report.json`.

### Options

The security testing script supports several options:

- `--full`: Run a comprehensive security scan (slower but more thorough)
- `--quick`: Run a quick security scan (default)
- `--api-only`: Only test API endpoints
- `--report-file <file>`: Output report to the specified file

Example:

```bash
node scripts/security-test.js --full --report-file security-reports/full-scan-2023-07-15.json
```bash

### Interpreting Results

The security scan produces a JSON report with the following structure:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2023-07-15T12:34:56.789Z",
  "summary": {
    "criticalVulnerabilities": 0,
    "highVulnerabilities": 1,
    "mediumVulnerabilities": 2,
    "lowVulnerabilities": 3,
    "infoFindings": 1
  },
  "riskScore": 25,
  "riskLevel": "Medium",
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "SEC-1",
      "severity": "high",
      "title": "Hardcoded API key",
      "description": "Found possible hardcoded API key in code",
      "location": "./src/services/externalApi.js",
      "remediation": "Remove sensitive information from code and use environment variables instead"
    },
    // Additional findings...
  ]
}
```bash

Each finding includes:
- __ID__: Unique identifier for the finding
- __Severity__: Critical, high, medium, low, or info
- __Title__: Brief description of the issue
- __Description__: Detailed explanation of the vulnerability
- __Location__: File or component where the issue was found
- __Remediation__: Recommended steps to fix the issue

### Risk Score

The security scan calculates a risk score from 0-100 based on the number and severity of findings:
- 0: No vulnerabilities
- 1-24: Low risk
- 25-49: Medium risk
- 50-74: High risk
- 75-100: Critical risk

## Continuous Security Testing

It's recommended to run security tests:
- As part of the CI/CD pipeline
- Before major releases
- After adding new dependencies
- After implementing significant new features

## Manual Security Testing

In addition to automated security testing, consider performing manual security testing:

1. __Penetration Testing__: Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities in the application
2. __Code Reviews__: Manual inspection of code for security issues
3. __Authentication Testing__: Verify that authentication mechanisms work as expected
4. __Authorization Testing__: Ensure proper access controls are in place
5. __Input Validation Testing__: Test how the application handles malicious input

## Security Testing Best Practices

1. __Regular Testing__: Run security tests regularly, not just when security issues are suspected
2. __Comprehensive Coverage__: Test all aspects of the application, not just the obvious entry
points
3. __Realistic Testing__: Use realistic test data and scenarios
4. __Track Progress__: Monitor security improvements over time
5. __Remediate Issues__: Address security issues in a timely manner based on severity
