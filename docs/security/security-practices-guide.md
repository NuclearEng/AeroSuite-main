# AeroSuite Security Practices Guide

## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive guidance on security practices for the AeroSuite platform. It is intended for developers, administrators, and security personnel working on the AeroSuite project. These practices should be followed throughout the development lifecycle to ensure the security and integrity of the application.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication

- **JWT Implementation**: AeroSuite uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
  - Tokens are signed with a strong algorithm (RS256)
  - Short expiration times (1 hour) with refresh token rotation
  - Tokens contain minimal user information to reduce exposure

- **Password Policies**:
  - Minimum 10 characters with complexity requirements
  - Password history enforcement (last 5 passwords)
  - Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
  - Secure password reset flow with expiring tokens

- **Multi-Factor Authentication**:
  - TOTP-based 2FA available for all users
  - Required for administrative accounts
  - Device management and trusted device tracking

### Authorization

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
  - Predefined roles with specific permissions
  - Custom roles can be created with granular permissions
  - Roles are enforced at both API and UI levels

- **Principle of Least Privilege**:
  - Users are granted minimal permissions needed for their job
  - Temporary elevated privileges with automatic expiration
  - Regular permission audits and reviews

- **Session Management**:
  - Automatic session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
  - Concurrent session limits (configurable)
  - Forced re-authentication for sensitive operations

## Data Protection

### Data at Rest

- **Encryption**:
  - AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
  - Database-level encryption for all PII
  - Secure key management using KMS

- **Data Classification**:
  - Clear labeling of data sensitivity levels
  - Handling procedures for each classification level
  - Access controls based on data classification

### Data in Transit

- **Transport Layer Security**:
  - TLS 1.2+ required for all connections
  - Strong cipher suites with forward secrecy
  - HSTS implementation
  - Certificate pinning for mobile applications

### Data Handling

- **Data Minimization**:
  - Collection limited to necessary information
  - Automatic data anonymization where possible
  - Regular data purging based on retention policies

- **Input Validation**:
  - Server-side validation for all inputs
  - Parameterized queries for database access
  - Input sanitization to prevent XSS and injection attacks

## API Security

### API Design

- **RESTful Security Best Practices**:
  - Resource-based permissions
  - Proper HTTP methods and status codes
  - Versioning to manage security changes

- **Rate Limiting**:
  - Per-user and per-IP rate limits
  - Graduated response to excessive requests
  - Anti-automation measures

### API Protection

- **Security Headers**:
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection

- **CORS Configuration**:
  - Strict origin validation
  - Limited exposed headers
  - Credentials handling

- **Error Handling**:
  - Generic error messages in production
  - Detailed logging for debugging without exposing sensitive information
  - No stack traces in responses

## Frontend Security

### Client-Side Protection

- **XSS Prevention**:
  - Content Security Policy implementation
  - Output encoding
  - React's built-in XSS protections
  - Sanitization libraries for user-generated content

- **State Management Security**:
  - Sensitive data never stored in localStorage
  - Session storage cleared on logout
  - Redux state sanitization

- **Secure Communication**:
  - HTTPS-only communication
  - API request/response encryption when needed
  - Secure WebSocket implementation

### UI/UX Security Considerations

- **Security Indicators**:
  - Clear login/logout status
  - Session timeout warnings
  - Permission-based UI rendering

- **Form Security**:
  - CSRF protection
  - Honeypot fields
  - Throttled submissions

## Backend Security

### Server Configuration

- **Secure Server Setup**:
  - Minimal required services
  - Regular patching and updates
  - Secure defaults for all components

- **Environment Management**:
  - Separation of development, testing, and production
  - Environment-specific security controls
  - No production data in non-production environments

### Code Security

- **Secure Coding Practices**:
  - Regular code reviews with security focus
  - Static code analysis integration
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning

- **Authentication Implementation**:
  - Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
  - Secure token generation and validation
  - Protection against timing attacks

- **Database Security**:
  - Parameterized queries
  - ORM security features
  - Least privilege database accounts

## Infrastructure Security

### Cloud Security

- **Provider Security**:
  - AWS/Azure/GCP security best practices
  - Security groups and network ACLs
  - Private subnets for sensitive components
