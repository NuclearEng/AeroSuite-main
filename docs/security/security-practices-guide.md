# AeroSuite Security Practices Guide

## Introduction

This document provides comprehensive guidance on security practices for the AeroSuite platform. It
is intended for developers, administrators, and security personnel working on the AeroSuite
project. These practices should be followed throughout the development lifecycle to ensure the
security and integrity of the application.

## Authentication and Authorization

### Authentication

- __JWT Implementation__: AeroSuite uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication.
  - Tokens are signed with a strong algorithm (RS256)
  - Short expiration times (1 hour) with refresh token rotation
  - Tokens contain minimal user information to reduce exposure

- __Password Policies__:
  - Minimum 10 characters with complexity requirements
  - Password history enforcement (last 5 passwords)
  - Account lockout after 5 failed attempts
  - Secure password reset flow with expiring tokens

- __Multi-Factor Authentication__:
  - TOTP-based 2FA available for all users
  - Required for administrative accounts
  - Device management and trusted device tracking

### Authorization

- __Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)__:
  - Predefined roles with specific permissions
  - Custom roles can be created with granular permissions
  - Roles are enforced at both API and UI levels

- __Principle of Least Privilege__:
  - Users are granted minimal permissions needed for their job
  - Temporary elevated privileges with automatic expiration
  - Regular permission audits and reviews

- __Session Management__:
  - Automatic session timeout after 30 minutes of inactivity
  - Concurrent session limits (configurable)
  - Forced re-authentication for sensitive operations

## Data Protection

### Data at Rest

- __Encryption__:
  - AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
  - Database-level encryption for all PII
  - Secure key management using KMS

- __Data Classification__:
  - Clear labeling of data sensitivity levels
  - Handling procedures for each classification level
  - Access controls based on data classification

### Data in Transit

- __Transport Layer Security__:
  - TLS 1.2+ required for all connections
  - Strong cipher suites with forward secrecy
  - HSTS implementation
  - Certificate pinning for mobile applications

### Data Handling

- __Data Minimization__:
  - Collection limited to necessary information
  - Automatic data anonymization where possible
  - Regular data purging based on retention policies

- __Input Validation__:
  - Server-side validation for all inputs
  - Parameterized queries for database access
  - Input sanitization to prevent XSS and injection attacks

## API Security

### API Design

- __RESTful Security Best Practices__:
  - Resource-based permissions
  - Proper HTTP methods and status codes
  - Versioning to manage security changes

- __Rate Limiting__:
  - Per-user and per-IP rate limits
  - Graduated response to excessive requests
  - Anti-automation measures

### API Protection

- __Security Headers__:
  - Content-Security-Policy
  - X-Content-Type-Options
  - X-Frame-Options
  - X-XSS-Protection

- __CORS Configuration__:
  - Strict origin validation
  - Limited exposed headers
  - Credentials handling

- __Error Handling__:
  - Generic error messages in production
  - Detailed logging for debugging without exposing sensitive information
  - No stack traces in responses

## Frontend Security

### Client-Side Protection

- __XSS Prevention__:
  - Content Security Policy implementation
  - Output encoding
  - React's built-in XSS protections
  - Sanitization libraries for user-generated content

- __State Management Security__:
  - Sensitive data never stored in localStorage
  - Session storage cleared on logout
  - Redux state sanitization

- __Secure Communication__:
  - HTTPS-only communication
  - API request/response encryption when needed
  - Secure WebSocket implementation

### UI/UX Security Considerations

- __Security Indicators__:
  - Clear login/logout status
  - Session timeout warnings
  - Permission-based UI rendering

- __Form Security__:
  - CSRF protection
  - Honeypot fields
  - Throttled submissions

## Backend Security

### Server Configuration

- __Secure Server Setup__:
  - Minimal required services
  - Regular patching and updates
  - Secure defaults for all components

- __Environment Management__:
  - Separation of development, testing, and production
  - Environment-specific security controls
  - No production data in non-production environments

### Code Security

- __Secure Coding Practices__:
  - Regular code reviews with security focus
  - Static code analysis integration
  - Dependency vulnerability scanning

- __Authentication Implementation__:
  - Secure password hashing (bcrypt)
  - Secure token generation and validation
