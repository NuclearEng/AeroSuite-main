# AeroSuite Security Practices

This document provides an overview of security practices, policies, and testing procedures for the AeroSuite project. It serves as the main entry point for all security-related documentation.

## Overview

AeroSuite implements a multi-layered security strategy covering:
- Authentication & Authorization
- Data Protection
- API Security
- Infrastructure Security
- Security Testing & Compliance

Security is integrated at all levels of the architecture, with regular reviews and updates to address new threats and requirements.

## Key Security Practices

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Principle of least privilege
- Two-factor authentication for sensitive operations
- Regular review of permissions and roles

### 2. Data Protection
- Input validation and sanitization for all user inputs
- Encryption of sensitive data in transit (HTTPS) and at rest
- Data minimization and filtering of sensitive fields from responses
- Proper data retention and deletion policies

### 3. API Security
- Strict HTTPS enforcement and security headers
- Rate limiting and brute force protection
- CORS configuration with strict origin controls
- Generic error messages in production
- Automated and manual security testing

### 4. Infrastructure Security
- Secrets management via environment variables
- Regular dependency and container security scanning
- Network segmentation and firewall rules
- Regular updates and patching
- Security monitoring and alerting

### 5. Security Testing
- Automated security scanning (OWASP ZAP, dependency checks)
- Static code analysis and code review
- Penetration testing
- Security incident response procedures
