## TS218: Supplier Audit Checklist Component

### Implementation Details
- Created a comprehensive supplier audit system with the following components:
  - Server-side: 
    - MongoDB model for supplier audits with checklist items and findings
    - Service layer for handling audit business logic
    - Controllers for HTTP request handling
    - Routes with proper authorization
  - Client-side:
    - Custom hook for managing audit state and operations
    - UI components for displaying and managing checklist items
    - Interactive interface for recording findings
    - Support for different question types (yes/no, scale, text, multiple choice)
    - Categorized checklist items by quality areas
    - Summary and reporting dashboard

### Security Considerations
- All API endpoints are protected with proper authentication and authorization
- Input validation to prevent injection attacks
- Authorization checks on all actions
- Proper error handling to prevent information leakage

### Future Enhancements
- PDF report generation for audits
- Email notification for findings and corrective actions
- Integration with supplier performance metrics
- Mobile-friendly audit data collection
- Historical trend analysis for audit results
