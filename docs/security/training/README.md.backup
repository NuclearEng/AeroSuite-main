2. [Secure Coding Practices](02-secure-coding-practices.md)
3. [Authentication & Authorization](03-authentication-authorization.md)
4. [Data Protection & Privacy](04-data-protection-privacy.md)
5. [API Security](05-api-security.md)
6. [Frontend Security](06-frontend-security.md)
7. [Infrastructure Security](07-infrastructure-security.md)
8. [Security Testing](08-security-testing.md)
9. [Incident Response](09-incident-response.md)
10. [Security Tools & Resources](10-security-tools-resources.md)

## Training Delivery

The security training program uses a blended learning approach:

1. __Interactive Workshops__: Led by security experts, focusing on practical applications
2. __Hands-on Labs__: Exercises to practice identifying and fixing security issues
3. __Self-paced Learning__: Online resources for continuous learning
4. __Security Champions__: Designated team members who receive advanced training
5. __Peer Reviews__: Security-focused code reviews to reinforce learning

## Training Materials

Each training module includes:

- Presentation slides
- Hands-on exercises
- Reference materials
- Assessment questions
- Real-world examples from our codebase

## Training Effectiveness Measurement

The effectiveness of the security training program is measured through:

1. Pre and post-training assessments
2. Reduction in security vulnerabilities found in code reviews
3. Improved security testing coverage
4. Faster identification and response to security issues
5. Security champions' feedback and observations

## Certification

Developers who complete the full training program receive an internal "AeroSuite Security-Minded 
Developer" certification. This certification must be renewed annually by completing refresher 
courses and demonstrating secure coding practices.
