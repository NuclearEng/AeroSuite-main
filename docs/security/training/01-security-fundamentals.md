# Security Fundamentals

## Module Overview

This module provides a foundational understanding of security concepts, common vulnerabilities, and security principles that every developer should know. It serves as the basis for all other security training modules.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Explain key security concepts and terminology
2. Identify the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and their impact
3. Apply security principles to development activities
4. Recognize security threats relevant to AeroSuite
5. Understand the security responsibilities of developers

## Topics Covered

### 1. Security Concepts and Terminology

- **CIA Triad**: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
- **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of security controls
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Minimum access necessary
- **Attack Surface**: Points where an attacker can attempt to enter
- **Threat Modeling**: Identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities

### 2. OWASP Top 10 Overview

- **Injection**: SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection flaws
- **Broken Authentication**: Authentication and session management flaws
- **Sensitive Data Exposure**: Insufficient protection of sensitive data
- **XML External Entities (XXE)**: Processing untrusted XML
- **Broken Access Control**: Improper enforcement of restrictions
- **Security Misconfiguration**: Insecure default configurations
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: Untrusted data execution in browsers
- **Insecure Deserialization**: Untrusted data deserialization
- **Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities**: Outdated or vulnerable components
- **Insufficient Logging & Monitoring**: Lack of detection and response capabilities

### 3. Security Principles for Developers

- **Secure by Design**: Building security in from the start
- **Fail Securely**: Errors and exceptions should not create security vulnerabilities
- **Economy of Mechanism**: Keep designs as simple as possible
- **Complete Mediation**: Check every access attempt
- **Open Design**: Security should not depend on secrecy of the design
- **Separation of Privilege**: Multiple conditions for access
- **Least Common Mechanism**: Minimize shared resources
- **Psychological Acceptability**: Security mechanisms should be user-friendly

### 4. AeroSuite Security Context

- **Sensitive Data in AeroSuite**: What we protect and why
- **Common Attack Vectors**: Specific threats to our application
- **Security Architecture**: Overview of our security controls
- **Regulatory Requirements**: Compliance obligations relevant to AeroSuite
- **Security Incident History**: Lessons learned from past incidents

### 5. Developer Security Responsibilities

- **Secure Coding**: Following secure coding guidelines
- **Security Testing**: Incorporating security tests
- **Vulnerability Management**: Addressing security issues
- **Security in the SDLC**: Security activities throughout development
- **Security Reporting**: How to report security concerns

## Hands-on Exercises

### Exercise 1: Threat Identification

Analyze a component of AeroSuite and identify potential security threats using the STRIDE model:
- Spoofing
- Tampering
- Repudiation
- Information Disclosure
- Denial of Service
- Elevation of Privilege

### Exercise 2: Vulnerability Recognition

Review code samples containing common vulnerabilities and identify the issues and their potential impact.

### Exercise 3: Security Principles Application

Apply security principles to improve the design of a given system component.

## Assessment

1. Multiple-choice questions on security concepts and OWASP Top 10
2. Scenario-based questions on applying security principles
3. Practical vulnerability identification in code samples
4. Short answer questions on developer security responsibilities
