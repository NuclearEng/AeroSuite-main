# Security Fundamentals

## Module Overview

This module provides a foundational understanding of security concepts, common vulnerabilities, and
security principles that every developer should know. It serves as the basis for all other security
training modules.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Explain key security concepts and terminology
2. Identify the OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities and their impact
3. Apply security principles to development activities
4. Recognize security threats relevant to AeroSuite
5. Understand the security responsibilities of developers

## Topics Covered

### 1. Security Concepts and Terminology

- __CIA Triad__: Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability
- __Defense in Depth__: Multiple layers of security controls
- __Principle of Least Privilege__: Minimum access necessary
- __Attack Surface__: Points where an attacker can attempt to enter
- __Threat Modeling__: Identifying potential threats and vulnerabilities

### 2. OWASP Top 10 Overview

- __Injection__: SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection flaws
- __Broken Authentication__: Authentication and session management flaws
- __Sensitive Data Exposure__: Insufficient protection of sensitive data
- __XML External Entities (XXE)__: Processing untrusted XML
- __Broken Access Control__: Improper enforcement of restrictions
- __Security Misconfiguration__: Insecure default configurations
- __Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)__: Untrusted data execution in browsers
- __Insecure Deserialization__: Untrusted data deserialization
- __Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities__: Outdated or vulnerable components
- __Insufficient Logging & Monitoring__: Lack of detection and response capabilities

### 3. Security Principles for Developers

- __Secure by Design__: Building security in from the start
- __Fail Securely__: Errors and exceptions should not create security vulnerabilities
- __Economy of Mechanism__: Keep designs as simple as possible
- __Complete Mediation__: Check every access attempt
- __Open Design__: Security should not depend on secrecy of the design
- __Separation of Privilege__: Multiple conditions for access
- __Least Common Mechanism__: Minimize shared resources
- __Psychological Acceptability__: Security mechanisms should be user-friendly

### 4. AeroSuite Security Context

- __Sensitive Data in AeroSuite__: What we protect and why
- __Common Attack Vectors__: Specific threats to our application
- __Security Architecture__: Overview of our security controls
- __Regulatory Requirements__: Compliance obligations relevant to AeroSuite
- __Security Incident History__: Lessons learned from past incidents

### 5. Developer Security Responsibilities

- __Secure Coding__: Following secure coding guidelines
- __Security Testing__: Incorporating security tests
- __Vulnerability Management__: Addressing security issues
- __Security in the SDLC__: Security activities throughout development
- __Security Reporting__: How to report security concerns

## Hands-on Exercises

### Exercise 1: Threat Identification

Analyze a component of AeroSuite and identify potential security threats using the STRIDE model:
- Spoofing
- Tampering
- Repudiation
- Information Disclosure
- Denial of Service
- Elevation of Privilege

### Exercise 2: Vulnerability Recognition

Review code samples containing common vulnerabilities and identify the issues and their potential
impact.

### Exercise 3: Security Principles Application

Apply security principles to improve the design of a given system component.

## Assessment

1. Multiple-choice questions on security concepts and OWASP Top 10
2. Scenario-based questions on applying security principles
3. Practical vulnerability identification in code samples
4. Short answer questions on developer security responsibilities
