# API Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security standards and best practices for API development and maintenance in the AeroSuite project.

## Overview

Our API security strategy is built on multiple layers of defense to protect sensitive data, prevent unauthorized access, and maintain system integrity. We perform regular security audits and testing to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively.

## Security Controls

### Authentication and Authorization

- **Authentication**: All endpoints that expose sensitive data or operations must verify user identity
  - JWT-based authentication with secure token handling
  - Tokens must expire after a reasonable time (default: 1 hour)
  - Refresh token rotation strategy for extended sessions
  - Multi-factor authentication for sensitive operations

- **Authorization**: Enforce strict access controls based on user roles and permissions
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) for all protected endpoints
  - Principle of least privilege for all accounts
  - Regular review of permissions and roles
  - Logging of all permission changes

### Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Request Validation**: All request parameters, headers, and bodies must be validated
  - Schema-based validation using [Joi](https://joi.dev/) or [express-validator](https://express-validator.github.io/)
  - Type checking and data constraints
  - Maximum size limits for all inputs
  - Validation of content types and accepted formats

- **Sanitization**: Proper sanitization to prevent injection attacks
  - HTML/Script tag sanitization for user-generated content
  - SQL query parameterization to prevent SQL injection
  - NoSQL injection protection
  - Regular expression validation for format-specific inputs (emails, dates, etc.)

### Security Headers

All API responses must include the following security headers:

- `Strict-Transport-Security`: Max age of at least 1 year
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `Content-Security-Policy`: Appropriate policies based on content
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer-when-downgrade`
- `Cache-Control`: Appropriate caching directives based on content sensitivity

### Rate Limiting and Brute Force Protection

- Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
- More restrictive limits on authentication-related endpoints
- Progressive delays for repeated failures
- IP-based and token-based rate limiting
- Clear response headers indicating limits and remaining requests

### CORS Configuration

- Strict Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policy
- Allow only specified origins for cross-origin requests
- Do not use wildcard origins with credentials
- Carefully validate all preflight requests
- Limit exposed headers to only what's necessary

### Error Handling

- Generic error messages in production
- No stack traces or sensitive system information in responses
- Consistent error format across all endpoints
- Appropriate HTTP status codes
- Detailed error logging for internal debugging

### Data Protection

- Encrypt sensitive data in transit (HTTPS)
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Data minimization: only return necessary data
- Filter out sensitive fields (passwords, keys, etc.) from responses
- Implement proper data retention policies

## Automated Security Testing

We use automated security testing to ensure ongoing compliance with security standards:

1. **API Security Audit**: Automated testing of all endpoints for common vulnerabilities
   - Runs on every significant code change
   - Scheduled weekly full scans
   - Covers authentication, authorization, injection, headers, etc.

2. **Dependency Scanning**: Regular checks for vulnerable dependencies
   - Automated with GitHub Dependabot and custom scanning tools
   - Alerts for any critical vulnerabilities

3. **Static Code Analysis**: Code scanning for security issues
   - Integration with code review process
   - Pre-commit hooks for security checks

4. **Penetration Testing**: Regular security testing by security professionals
   - Scheduled comprehensive tests
   - Focus on critical components and new features

## Security Incident Response

1. **Detection**: Monitoring systems for detecting security incidents
2. **Containment**: Procedures for containing the impact of incidents
3. **Eradication**: Removing the cause of incidents
4. **Recovery**: Restoring affected systems
5. **Post-Incident Analysis**: Learning from incidents to prevent recurrence

## Compliance Requirements

Our API security measures are designed to meet the following compliance standards:

- OWASP API Security Top 10
- GDPR data protection requirements
- PCI DSS (if handling payment information)
- Industry-specific regulations as applicable

## Reporting Security Issues

Security issues should be reported according to our security vulnerability disclosure policy:

1. Report directly to the security team at security@aerosuite.example.com
2. Do not disclose security vulnerabilities publicly without coordination
3. Provide detailed information to reproduce the issue
4. Allow reasonable time for remediation before disclosure
