# Regular Security Scanning

This document describes the automated security scanning system implemented in the AeroSuite application.

## Overview

The security scanning system performs comprehensive security checks to identify vulnerabilities, security misconfigurations, and compliance issues in the application. These scans run automatically on a schedule and during the development process to ensure consistent security monitoring.

## Scan Types

The system includes the following types of security scans:

1. **Dependency Vulnerability Scanning**: Checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
2. **Static Code Analysis**: Identifies code-level security issues and coding standards violations
3. **API Security Testing**: Tests API endpoints for common security vulnerabilities
4. **OWASP Top 10 Compliance**: Verifies compliance with OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
5. **Secrets Detection**: Identifies potentially leaked secrets in the codebase

## Automated Scan Schedule

Security scans run automatically at the following times:

- **Weekly Comprehensive Scan**: Every Monday at 2:00 AM UTC
- **Dependency Scans**: When dependency files change (package.json, package-lock.json)
- **Code Scans**: When code is pushed to the main/master branch
- **Manual Triggering**: On-demand through GitHub Actions

## Security Scan Implementation

### Main Components

1. **Regular Security Scan Script** (`scripts/regular-security-scan.js`): Coordinates all security scanning tools
2. **Dependency Scan Script** (`scripts/security-scan.js`): Scans for vulnerable dependencies
3. **OWASP Top 10 Audit Script** (`scripts/owasp-top10-audit.js`): Checks compliance with OWASP guidelines
4. **GitHub Workflow** (`.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`): Automates scan execution and reporting

### Scan Report Formats

The system generates reports in the following formats:

- **JSON Reports**: Detailed scan results in machine-readable format
- **HTML Reports**: Human-friendly reports with visual summaries
- **GitHub Workflow Summaries**: Quick overview of scan results in GitHub Actions

Reports are stored in the `security-reports` directory with timestamped filenames.

## Using the Security Scanning System

### Running Scans Manually

You can run security scans manually using the following commands:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/regular-security-scan.js

# Run all security scans
node scripts/regular-security-scan.js --full

# Run specific scan types
node scripts/regular-security-scan.js --dependency-scan --code-scan

# Generate verbose output
node scripts/regular-security-scan.js --full --verbose
```

### Command Line Options

The `regular-security-scan.js` script supports the following options:

- `--dependency-scan` or `-d`: Run dependency vulnerability scan
- `--code-scan` or `-c`: Run static code analysis
- `--api-scan` or `-a`: Run API security scan
- `--owasp-scan` or `-o`: Run OWASP Top 10 audit
- `--secrets-scan` or `-s`: Run secrets detection scan
- `--full` or `-f`: Run all available scans
- `--report-dir <dir>`: Specify directory for storing reports
- `--ci`: Run in CI mode (non-interactive, exit code reflects status)
- `--verbose` or `-v`: Enable verbose output

### Viewing Scan Results

Scan results are available in the following ways:

1. **Local Reports**: Check the `security-reports` directory for JSON and HTML reports
2. **GitHub Actions**: View scan results in the GitHub Actions workflow
3. **Artifact Downloads**: Download reports as artifacts from GitHub Actions runs

## Responding to Security Findings

When security issues are found, follow these steps:

1. **Assess Severity**: Evaluate the severity and potential impact of each finding
2. **Prioritize Fixes**: Address critical and high-severity issues first
3. **Create Issues**: For significant findings, create GitHub issues with appropriate tags
4. **Implement Fixes**: Develop and test fixes for identified issues
5. **Verify Remediation**: Re-run scans to verify that issues have been resolved

### Severity Levels

Findings are categorized with the following severity levels:

- **Critical**: Must be fixed immediately; potential for significant data breach or system compromise
- **High**: Should be fixed in the next release; important security issues
- **Medium**: Should be planned for remediation; moderate security risk
- **Low**: Should be addressed during regular maintenance; minimal risk
- **Info**: Informational findings; no immediate security risk

## Security Scan Configuration

### Customizing Scan Thresholds

You can customize the security scan thresholds by modifying the following files:

- **Dependency Scan**: Edit `scripts/security-scan.js` to change `MAX_ALLOWED_SEVERITY`
- **OWASP Compliance**: Edit `scripts/owasp-top10-audit.js` to adjust checks and weights

### Adding Custom Scan Rules

To add custom security scan rules:

1. Identify the appropriate scan script to modify
2. Add your custom check function
3. Update the report generation to include your new check
4. Test your custom check with known-vulnerable and secure code

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Reviews**: Review security scan reports regularly, not just when issues are flagged
2. **Continuous Improvement**: Use scan results to improve security practices and codebase quality
3. **Developer Education**: Share scan results with the development team to raise security awareness
4. **Verification**: Don't rely solely on automated scans; combine with manual testing for critical components
5. **Update Dependencies**: Keep dependencies updated to minimize vulnerability exposure

## Integration with Development Workflow

Security scanning is integrated into the development workflow in the following ways:

1. **Pull Requests**: Scans run automatically on pull requests to main/master
2. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Security scan results can block deployments if critical issues are found
3. **Developer Feedback**: Scan results provide immediate feedback to developers

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the security scanning system:

1. **Check Prerequisites**: Ensure all required tools are installed
2. **Review Logs**: Check the scan output for error messages
3. **Update Tools**: Make sure you're using the latest version of all scanning tools
4. **Individual Scans**: Try running specific scan types individually to isolate issues

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the security scanning system:

1. **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)**: Add runtime security testing
2. **Improved Secret Detection**: Enhance secret detection capabilities
3. **Custom Rule Creation UI**: Add a UI for creating custom security rules
4. **Trend Analysis**: Analyze security trends over time
5. **Integration with Security Tools**: Add integration with additional security tools and services
