# Regular Security Scanning

This document describes the automated security scanning system implemented in the AeroSuite
application.

## Overview

The security scanning system performs comprehensive security checks to identify vulnerabilities,
security misconfigurations, and compliance issues in the application. These scans run automatically
on a schedule and during the development process to ensure consistent security monitoring.

## Scan Types

The system includes the following types of security scans:

1. __Dependency Vulnerability Scanning__: Checks for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
2. __Static Code Analysis__: Identifies code-level security issues and coding standards violations
3. __API Security Testing__: Tests API endpoints for common security vulnerabilities
4. __OWASP Top 10 Compliance__: Verifies compliance with OWASP Top 10 security guidelines
5. __Secrets Detection__: Identifies potentially leaked secrets in the codebase

## Automated Scan Schedule

Security scans run automatically at the following times:

- __Weekly Comprehensive Scan__: Every Monday at 2:00 AM UTC
- __Dependency Scans__: When dependency files change (package.json, package-lock.json)
- __Code Scans__: When code is pushed to the main/master branch
- __Manual Triggering__: On-demand through GitHub Actions

## Security Scan Implementation

### Main Components

1. __Regular Security Scan Script__ (`scripts/regular-security-scan.js`): Coordinates all security
scanning tools
2. __Dependency Scan Script__ (`scripts/security-scan.js`): Scans for vulnerable dependencies
3. __OWASP Top 10 Audit Script__ (`scripts/owasp-top10-audit.js`): Checks compliance with OWASP
guidelines
4. __GitHub Workflow__ (`.github/workflows/security-scan.yml`): Automates scan execution and
reporting

### Scan Report Formats

The system generates reports in the following formats:

- __JSON Reports__: Detailed scan results in machine-readable format
- __HTML Reports__: Human-friendly reports with visual summaries
- __GitHub Workflow Summaries__: Quick overview of scan results in GitHub Actions

Reports are stored in the `security-reports` directory with timestamped filenames.

## Using the Security Scanning System

### Running Scans Manually

You can run security scans manually using the following commands:

```bash
# Make the script executable
chmod +x scripts/regular-security-scan.js

# Run all security scans
node scripts/regular-security-scan.js --full

# Run specific scan types
node scripts/regular-security-scan.js --dependency-scan --code-scan

# Generate verbose output
node scripts/regular-security-scan.js --full --verbose
```bash

### Command Line Options

The `regular-security-scan.js` script supports the following options:

- `--dependency-scan` or `-d`: Run dependency vulnerability scan
- `--code-scan` or `-c`: Run static code analysis
- `--api-scan` or `-a`: Run API security scan
- `--owasp-scan` or `-o`: Run OWASP Top 10 audit
- `--secrets-scan` or `-s`: Run secrets detection scan
- `--full` or `-f`: Run all available scans
- `--report-dir <dir>`: Specify directory for storing reports
- `--ci`: Run in CI mode (non-interactive, exit code reflects status)
- `--verbose` or `-v`: Enable verbose output

### Viewing Scan Results

Scan results are available in the following ways:

1. __Local Reports__: Check the `security-reports` directory for JSON and HTML reports
2. __GitHub Actions__: View scan results in the GitHub Actions workflow
3. __Artifact Downloads__: Download reports as artifacts from GitHub Actions runs

## Responding to Security Findings

When security issues are found, follow these steps:

1. __Assess Severity__: Evaluate the severity and potential impact of each finding
2. __Prioritize Fixes__: Address critical and high-severity issues first
3. __Create Issues__: For significant findings, create GitHub issues with appropriate tags
4. __Implement Fixes__: Develop and test fixes for identified issues
5. __Verify Remediation__: Re-run scans to verify that issues have been resolved

### Severity Levels

Findings are categorized with the following severity levels:

- __Critical__: Must be fixed immediately; potential for significant data breach or system
compromise
- __High__: Should be fixed in the next release; important security issues
- __Medium__: Should be planned for remediation; moderate security risk
- __Low__: Should be addressed during regular maintenance; minimal risk
- __Info__: Informational findings; no immediate security risk

## Security Scan Configuration

### Customizing Scan Thresholds

You can customize the security scan thresholds by modifying the following files:

- __Dependency Scan__: Edit `scripts/security-scan.js` to change `MAX_ALLOWED_SEVERITY`
- __OWASP Compliance__: Edit `scripts/owasp-top10-audit.js` to adjust checks and weights

### Adding Custom Scan Rules

To add custom security scan rules:

1. Identify the appropriate scan script to modify
2. Add your custom check function
3. Update the report generation to include your new check
4. Test your custom check with known-vulnerable and secure code

## Best Practices

1. __Regular Reviews__: Review security scan reports regularly, not just when issues are flagged
2. __Continuous Improvement__: Use scan results to improve security practices and codebase quality
3. __Developer Education__: Share scan results with the development team to raise security awareness
4. __Verification__: Don't rely solely on automated scans; combine with manual testing for critical
components
5. __Update Dependencies__: Keep dependencies updated to minimize vulnerability exposure

## Integration with Development Workflow

Security scanning is integrated into the development workflow in the following ways:

1. __Pull Requests__: Scans run automatically on pull requests to main/master
2. __CI/CD Pipeline__: Security scan results can block deployments if critical issues are found
3. __Developer Feedback__: Scan results provide immediate feedback to developers

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the security scanning system:

1. __Check Prerequisites__: Ensure all required tools are installed
2. __Review Logs__: Check the scan output for error messages
3. __Update Tools__: Make sure you're using the latest version of all scanning tools
4. __Individual Scans__: Try running specific scan types individually to isolate issues

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the security scanning system:

1. __Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST)__: Add runtime security testing
2. __Improved Secret Detection__: Enhance secret detection capabilities
3. __Custom Rule Creation UI__: Add a UI for creating custom security rules
4. __Trend Analysis__: Analyze security trends over time
5. __Integration with Security Tools__: Add integration with additional security tools and services
