# React Router Testing Solution

## Overview

This directory contains documentation and resources for the React Router testing solution 
implemented in the AeroSuite application (Task DEV004). The solution addresses issues with testing 
React components that use React Router hooks like `useNavigate` and `useParams`.

## Problem

Components using React Router hooks were failing in tests with errors like:

```bash
Error: useNavigate() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component.
```bash

This occurred because React Router hooks need to be used within a Router context, but our tests 
were rendering components in isolation.

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive solution with the following components:

1. __Basic Testing Utilities__
   - `router-wrapper.tsx`: For components using React Router hooks
   - `theme-wrapper.tsx`: For components using Material-UI Theme
   - `combined-wrapper.tsx`: For components using both
   - `test-setup.tsx`: Custom render function with necessary providers

2. __Advanced Testing Utilities__
   - `advanced-router-wrapper.tsx`: Enhanced utilities for authentication, role-based access, and 
query parameters
   - Authentication context for protected routes
   - Role-based access control testing
   - Query parameter handling
   - Navigation history tracking

3. __Global Mocks__
   - Updated `setupTests.ts` to include mocks for React Router hooks

4. __Automation Scripts__
   - `fix-router-tests.sh`: Main script with menu interface
   - Interactive mode: Fix tests one by one
   - Batch mode: Fix all tests at once
   - Directory mode: Fix tests in a specific directory

## Getting Started

To get started with the React Router testing solution:

1. Read the [Quick Start Guide](./react-router-testing-quickstart.md)
2. Use the [Cheat Sheet](./react-router-testing-cheatsheet.md) for reference
3. Try the automation scripts in the `scripts` directory
4. For advanced scenarios, see the [Advanced Router Testing](./advanced-router-testing.md) guide

## Components Fixed

- __Customer components:__ CustomerDetail, CustomerList, EditCustomer
- __Supplier components:__ SupplierDetail, SupplierList, SupplierEdit, EditSupplier
- __Inspection components:__ InspectionDetail, InspectionList, ScheduleInspection, 
InspectionAnalytics, ConductInspection

## Benefits

1. __Consistent Testing Approach__: All components follow a consistent approach
2. __Improved Test Reliability__: Tests properly simulate the environment
3. __Reduced Boilerplate__: Utility functions reduce boilerplate code
4. __Better Mocking__: Proper mocks for React Router hooks
5. __Easier Maintenance__: Centralized approach for easier maintenance
6. __Automation__: Scripts help automate the process of fixing tests
7. __Advanced Testing__: Support for complex routing scenarios with authentication and query 
parameters
