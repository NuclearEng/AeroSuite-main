# React Router Testing Fixes - Summary

## Problem

Components using React Router hooks like `useNavigate`, `useParams`, etc. were failing in tests 
with errors like:

```bash
Error: useNavigate() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component.
```bash

This occurred because these hooks need to be used within a Router context, but our tests were 
rendering components in isolation.

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive solution with the following components:

1. __Testing Utilities__:
   - Created `router-wrapper.tsx` with `renderWithRouter` function and `RouterWrapper` component
   - Created `theme-wrapper.tsx` with `renderWithTheme` function and `ThemeWrapper` component
   - Created `combined-wrapper.tsx` with `renderWithRouterAndTheme` function and `CombinedWrapper` 
component
   - Updated `test-setup.tsx` to provide a custom render function with necessary providers

2. __Global Mocks__:
   - Updated `setupTests.ts` to include mocks for React Router hooks
   - Added global mocks for fetch, localStorage, and IntersectionObserver

3. __Component Test Updates__:
   - Updated `CustomerDetail.test.tsx`, `CustomerList.test.tsx`, and `EditCustomer.test.tsx` to use 
`renderWithRouter`
   - Updated `SupplierDetail.test.tsx` and `SupplierList.test.tsx` to use `renderWithRouterAndTheme`

4. __Documentation and Scripts__:
   - Created documentation in `docs/testing/react-router-testing.md`
   - Added a README in `client/src/test-utils/README.md`
   - Created a script to run tests for React Router components in 
`client/scripts/test-router-components.sh`

## Benefits

1. __Consistent Testing Approach__: Standardized approach for testing components that use React 
Router hooks
2. __Reduced Boilerplate__: Reusable utilities reduce the amount of code needed in each test
3. __Better Test Coverage__: Components can now be properly tested with their Router context
4. __Improved Developer Experience__: Clear documentation and examples make it easier for 
developers to write tests

## Next Steps

1. Update remaining component tests to use these utilities
2. Add more comprehensive tests for navigation, URL parameters, and query parameters
3. Consider adding utilities for testing components that use Redux, Context API, etc.
4. Add automated tests to verify that components are properly wrapped with the necessary providers
