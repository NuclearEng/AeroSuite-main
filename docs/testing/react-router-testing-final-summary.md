# React Router Testing Fixes - Final Summary

## Problem

Components using React Router hooks like `useNavigate`, `useParams`, etc. were failing in tests with errors like:

```
Error: useNavigate() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component.
```

This occurred because these hooks need to be used within a Router context, but our tests were rendering components in isolation.

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive solution with the following components:

1. **Testing Utilities**:
   - Created `router-wrapper.tsx` with `renderWithRouter` function and `RouterWrapper` component
   - Created `theme-wrapper.tsx` with `renderWithTheme` function and `ThemeWrapper` component
   - Created `combined-wrapper.tsx` with `renderWithRouterAndTheme` function and `CombinedWrapper` component
   - Updated `test-setup.tsx` with a custom render function that wraps components with necessary providers

2. **Global Mocks**:
   - Updated `setupTests.ts` to include mocks for React Router hooks, fetch, localStorage, and IntersectionObserver

3. **Component Tests Updated**:
   - Customer components: `CustomerDetail.test.tsx`, `CustomerList.test.tsx`, `EditCustomer.test.tsx`
   - Supplier components: `SupplierDetail.test.tsx`, `SupplierList.test.tsx`, `SupplierEdit.test.tsx`, `EditSupplier.test.tsx`
   - Inspection components: `InspectionDetail.test.tsx`, `InspectionList.test.tsx`, `ScheduleInspection.test.tsx`, `InspectionAnalytics.test.tsx`, `ConductInspection.test.tsx`

4. **Documentation and Scripts**:
   - Created documentation in `docs/testing/react-router-testing.md`
   - Created README file in `client/src/test-utils/README.md`
   - Created scripts to help automate the process of updating component tests

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Testing Approach**: All components now follow a consistent approach to testing React Router components.
2. **Improved Test Reliability**: Tests now properly simulate the environment in which components will be used.
3. **Reduced Boilerplate**: The utility functions reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed in each test.
4. **Better Mocking**: Proper mocks for React Router hooks and other dependencies make tests more reliable.
5. **Easier Maintenance**: The centralized approach makes it easier to maintain and update tests in the future.

## Next Steps

1. Continue updating other component tests to use the new testing utilities
2. Consider creating additional testing utilities for other common contexts like Redux store
3. Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases and error handling
4. Improve the scripts to automate the process of updating tests even further
