# React Router Testing Fixes - Summary

## Problem

Components using React Router hooks like `useNavigate`, `useParams`, etc. were failing in tests with errors like:

```
Error: useNavigate() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component.
```

This occurred because these hooks need to be used within a Router context, but our tests were rendering components in isolation.

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive solution with the following components:

1. **Testing Utilities**:
   - Created `router-wrapper.tsx` with `renderWithRouter` function and `RouterWrapper` component
   - Created `theme-wrapper.tsx` with `renderWithTheme` function and `ThemeWrapper` component
   - Created `combined-wrapper.tsx` with `renderWithRouterAndTheme` function and `CombinedWrapper` component
   - Updated `test-setup.tsx` to provide a custom render function with necessary providers

2. **Global Mocks**:
   - Updated `setupTests.ts` to include mocks for React Router hooks
   - Added global mocks for fetch, localStorage, and IntersectionObserver

3. **Component Test Updates**:
   - Updated `CustomerDetail.test.tsx`, `CustomerList.test.tsx`, and `EditCustomer.test.tsx` to use `renderWithRouter`
   - Updated `SupplierDetail.test.tsx` and `SupplierList.test.tsx` to use `renderWithRouterAndTheme`

4. **Documentation and Scripts**:
   - Created documentation in `docs/testing/react-router-testing.md`
   - Added a README in `client/src/test-utils/README.md`
   - Created a script to run tests for React Router components in `client/scripts/test-router-components.sh`

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Testing Approach**: Standardized approach for testing components that use React Router hooks
2. **Reduced Boilerplate**: Reusable utilities reduce the amount of code needed in each test
3. **Better Test Coverage**: Components can now be properly tested with their Router context
4. **Improved Developer Experience**: Clear documentation and examples make it easier for developers to write tests

## Next Steps

1. Update remaining component tests to use these utilities
2. Add more comprehensive tests for navigation, URL parameters, and query parameters
3. Consider adding utilities for testing components that use Redux, Context API, etc.
4. Add automated tests to verify that components are properly wrapped with the necessary providers
