# React Router Testing Solution

## Overview

This directory contains documentation and resources for the React Router testing solution implemented in the AeroSuite application (Task DEV004). The solution addresses issues with testing React components that use React Router hooks like `useNavigate` and `useParams`.

## Problem

Components using React Router hooks were failing in tests with errors like:

```
Error: useNavigate() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component.
```

This occurred because React Router hooks need to be used within a Router context, but our tests were rendering components in isolation.

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive solution with the following components:

1. **Basic Testing Utilities**
   - `router-wrapper.tsx`: For components using React Router hooks
   - `theme-wrapper.tsx`: For components using Material-UI Theme
   - `combined-wrapper.tsx`: For components using both
   - `test-setup.tsx`: Custom render function with necessary providers

2. **Advanced Testing Utilities**
   - `advanced-router-wrapper.tsx`: Enhanced utilities for authentication, role-based access, and query parameters
   - Authentication context for protected routes
   - Role-based access control testing
   - Query parameter handling
   - Navigation history tracking

3. **Global Mocks**
   - Updated `setupTests.ts` to include mocks for React Router hooks

4. **Automation Scripts**
   - `fix-router-tests.sh`: Main script with menu interface
   - Interactive mode: Fix tests one by one
   - Batch mode: Fix all tests at once
   - Directory mode: Fix tests in a specific directory

## Getting Started

To get started with the React Router testing solution:

1. Read the [Quick Start Guide](./react-router-testing-quickstart.md)
2. Use the [Cheat Sheet](./react-router-testing-cheatsheet.md) for reference
3. Try the automation scripts in the `scripts` directory
4. For advanced scenarios, see the [Advanced Router Testing](./advanced-router-testing.md) guide

## Components Fixed

- **Customer components:** CustomerDetail, CustomerList, EditCustomer
- **Supplier components:** SupplierDetail, SupplierList, SupplierEdit, EditSupplier
- **Inspection components:** InspectionDetail, InspectionList, ScheduleInspection, InspectionAnalytics, ConductInspection

## Benefits

1. **Consistent Testing Approach**: All components follow a consistent approach
2. **Improved Test Reliability**: Tests properly simulate the environment
3. **Reduced Boilerplate**: Utility functions reduce boilerplate code
4. **Better Mocking**: Proper mocks for React Router hooks
5. **Easier Maintenance**: Centralized approach for easier maintenance
6. **Automation**: Scripts help automate the process of fixing tests
7. **Advanced Testing**: Support for complex routing scenarios with authentication and query parameters
