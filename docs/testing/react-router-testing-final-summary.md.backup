# React Router Testing Fixes - Final Summary

## Problem

Components using React Router hooks like `useNavigate`, `useParams`, etc. were failing in tests 
with errors like:

```bash
Error: useNavigate() may be used only in the context of a <Router> component.
```bash

This occurred because these hooks need to be used within a Router context, but our tests were 
rendering components in isolation.

## Solution

We implemented a comprehensive solution with the following components:

1. __Testing Utilities__:
   - Created `router-wrapper.tsx` with `renderWithRouter` function and `RouterWrapper` component
   - Created `theme-wrapper.tsx` with `renderWithTheme` function and `ThemeWrapper` component
   - Created `combined-wrapper.tsx` with `renderWithRouterAndTheme` function and `CombinedWrapper` 
component
   - Updated `test-setup.tsx` with a custom render function that wraps components with necessary 
providers

2. __Global Mocks__:
   - Updated `setupTests.ts` to include mocks for React Router hooks, fetch, localStorage, and 
IntersectionObserver

3. __Component Tests Updated__:
   - Customer components: `CustomerDetail.test.tsx`, `CustomerList.test.tsx`, 
`EditCustomer.test.tsx`
   - Supplier components: `SupplierDetail.test.tsx`, `SupplierList.test.tsx`, 
`SupplierEdit.test.tsx`, `EditSupplier.test.tsx`
   - Inspection components: `InspectionDetail.test.tsx`, `InspectionList.test.tsx`, 
`ScheduleInspection.test.tsx`, `InspectionAnalytics.test.tsx`, `ConductInspection.test.tsx`

4. __Documentation and Scripts__:
   - Created documentation in `docs/testing/react-router-testing.md`
   - Created README file in `client/src/test-utils/README.md`
   - Created scripts to help automate the process of updating component tests

## Benefits

1. __Consistent Testing Approach__: All components now follow a consistent approach to testing 
React Router components.
2. __Improved Test Reliability__: Tests now properly simulate the environment in which components 
will be used.
3. __Reduced Boilerplate__: The utility functions reduce the amount of boilerplate code needed in 
each test.
4. __Better Mocking__: Proper mocks for React Router hooks and other dependencies make tests more 
reliable.
5. __Easier Maintenance__: The centralized approach makes it easier to maintain and update tests in 
the future.

## Next Steps

1. Continue updating other component tests to use the new testing utilities
2. Consider creating additional testing utilities for other common contexts like Redux store
3. Add more comprehensive tests for edge cases and error handling
4. Improve the scripts to automate the process of updating tests even further
