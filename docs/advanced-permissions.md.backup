# Advanced User Permissions Management in AeroSuite

This document describes the advanced permission management system implemented in AeroSuite. The 
system provides fine-grained control over user permissions beyond the basic role-based access 
control.

## Overview

The advanced permission system enhances the basic role-based access control (RBAC) with the 
following features:

- Fine-grained permissions based on action and resource
- Organized permissions by category
- Custom permissions for individual users
- Permission overrides (both granting and denying)
- Caching for performance optimization
- API endpoints for permission management

## Permission Structure

Permissions follow a structured naming convention:

```bash
category:action:resource
```bash

For example:
- `supplier:read` - Permission to view suppliers
- `inspection:create:defect` - Permission to create defect records in inspections
- `user:update:permission` - Permission to modify user permissions

Each permission has the following attributes:
- __Name__: Unique identifier (e.g., `supplier:read`)
- __Description__: Human-readable description
- __Category__: Functional area (e.g., supplier, customer, inspection)
- __Action__: Operation (create, read, update, delete, manage, approve, execute, export)
- __Resource__: Target of the action (e.g., supplier, inspection, defect)

## Role Management

Roles are collections of permissions. The system comes with five default roles:

1. __Admin__: Full system access
2. __Manager__: Access to most features except some administrative functions
3. __Inspector__: Access to inspection features and limited supplier/customer access
4. __Customer__: Limited access to their own data
5. __Viewer__: Read-only access to most data

Roles have the following attributes:
- __Name__: Unique identifier
- __Description__: Human-readable description
- __Permissions__: Array of permission names
- __IsSystem__: Flag indicating if the role is a system default (cannot be deleted)
- __Priority__: Numerical priority (higher takes precedence in case of conflicts)
- __IsActive__: Flag indicating if the role is active

Custom roles can be created with specific sets of permissions tailored to your organization's needs.

## User Custom Permissions

Beyond role-based permissions, individual users can have custom permissions:

- __Granted Permissions__: Additional permissions granted to the user
- __Denied Permissions__: Permissions explicitly denied to the user (overrides role permissions)

The effective permissions for a user are calculated as:
```bash
(Role Permissions + Granted Permissions) - Denied Permissions
```bash

This allows for flexible permission assignment without creating numerous specialized roles.

## API Endpoints

The permission system exposes the following API endpoints:

### Permission Management

- `GET /api/v2/permissions`: Get all permissions
- `GET /api/v2/permissions/category/:category`: Get permissions by category
- `POST /api/v2/permissions/categories`: Get permissions by multiple categories
- `POST /api/v2/permissions`: Create a new permission
- `PUT /api/v2/permissions/:id`: Update a permission
- `DELETE /api/v2/permissions/:id`: Delete a permission
- `POST /api/v2/permissions/initialize`: Initialize default permissions and roles

### Role Management

- `GET /api/v2/permissions/roles`: Get all roles
- `GET /api/v2/permissions/roles/:name`: Get role by name
- `GET /api/v2/permissions/roles/:name/permissions`: Get role permissions
- `POST /api/v2/permissions/roles`: Create a new role
- `PUT /api/v2/permissions/roles/:name`: Update a role
- `PUT /api/v2/permissions/roles/:name/permissions`: Update role permissions
- `POST /api/v2/permissions/roles/:name/permissions`: Add permissions to role
- `DELETE /api/v2/permissions/roles/:name/permissions`: Remove permissions from role
- `DELETE /api/v2/permissions/roles/:name`: Delete a role

### User Permission Management

- `GET /api/v2/permissions/users/:id`: Get user permissions
- `PUT /api/v2/permissions/users/:id`: Update user custom permissions
- `POST /api/v2/permissions/users/:id`: Add custom permissions to user
- `DELETE /api/v2/permissions/users/:id`: Remove custom permissions or clear all

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Custom Role

```javascript
// Example request to create a Quality Manager role
const response = await fetch('/api/v2/permissions/roles', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'quality_manager',
    description: 'Quality Management Team Lead',
    permissions: [
      'supplier:read',
      'supplier:read:performance',
      'supplier:read:risk',
      'supplier:update:risk',
      'inspection:read',
      'inspection:create',
      'inspection:update',
      'inspection:approve',
      'inspection:read:report',
      'inspection:export:report',
      'report:create',
      'report:read',
      'report:export'
    ],
    priority: 70
  })
});
```bash

### Adding Custom Permissions to a User

```javascript
// Example request to grant additional permissions to a user
const response = await fetch(`/api/v2/permissions/users/${userId}`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    permissions: ['supplier:manage', 'customer:manage'],
    type: 'granted'
  })
});
```bash

### Denying Specific Permissions to a User

```javascript
// Example request to deny specific permissions to a user
const response = await fetch(`/api/v2/permissions/users/${userId}`, {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    permissions: ['user:delete', 'user:update:role'],
    type: 'denied'
  })
});
```bash

## Best Practices

1. __Minimize Custom Roles__: Try to use the default roles when possible, as they are maintained 
and updated with the system.

2. __Use Custom Permissions Sparingly__: Prefer role-based permissions for most users and only add 
custom permissions when necessary.

3. __Document Custom Roles__: Keep documentation of any custom roles you create, including what 
permissions they have and why they were created.

4. __Audit Regularly__: Regularly review user permissions to ensure they are appropriate for each 
user's current responsibilities.

5. __Follow Least Privilege Principle__: Grant the minimum permissions needed for a user to perform 
their job.

6. __Use Denied Permissions Carefully__: Denied permissions override role permissions, which can 
lead to unexpected behavior if not managed carefully.

7. __Test Permission Changes__: After making significant permission changes, test the system to 
ensure everything works as expected.

8. __Consider Role Hierarchy__: When creating custom roles, consider the priority level to 
establish a clear hierarchy.

9. __Group Related Permissions__: When assigning custom permissions, group them logically by 
functional area or task.
