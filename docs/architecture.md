## System Overview

AeroSuite is a quality management system designed for aerospace manufacturers and suppliers. It
provides comprehensive tools for:

- Supplier qualification and management
- Inspection planning and execution
- Quality data analysis and reporting
- Document management
- Customer relationship management

The system follows a modern microservices-inspired architecture while maintaining a monolithic
deployment for simplicity and developer productivity.

## Architectural Principles

The architecture is guided by the following principles:

1. __Separation of Concerns__: Clearly defined responsibilities for each component
2. __Modularity__: Independent, replaceable components
3. __API-First Design__: All functionality exposed through well-defined APIs
4. __Scalability__: Components designed to scale horizontally
5. __Security by Design__: Security integrated at all levels
6. __Observability__: Comprehensive monitoring and logging
7. __Testability__: Components designed for automated testing
8. __Progressive Enhancement__: Core functionality works without JavaScript
9. __Responsive Design__: UI adapts to different device sizes
10. __Offline Capability__: Critical features work offline

## High-Level Architecture

AeroSuite follows a three-tier architecture:
