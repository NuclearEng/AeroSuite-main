# AeroSuite Task Traceability System

This document provides an overview of AeroSuite's task traceability system, which enables bidirectional traceability between tasks and code.

## Overview

The task traceability system provides:

1. **Task-to-Code Traceability**: Easily identify which code files implement a specific task.
2. **Code-to-Task Traceability**: Determine which task(s) a code file is associated with.
3. **Automated Enforcement**: Git hooks enforce task references in commit messages and files.
4. **Visualization**: Visual reports showing task-to-code relationships.
5. **Metrics Dashboard**: Track traceability coverage and task status.
6. **JIRA Integration**: Synchronize tasks between the local task tracker and JIRA.

## Components

The system consists of the following components:

### 1. Enhanced Task Reference Manager

**File**: `scripts/task-management/enhanced-task-reference.js`

This tool provides advanced functionality for maintaining task references:
- Automatic detection of files related to specific tasks
- Adding standardized task references to files
- Generating visualization of task-to-code relationships
- Integration with git hooks

**Usage**:
```bash
# Interactive mode (select a task and add references)
node scripts/task-management/enhanced-task-reference.js

# Automatic mode (process all tasks)
node scripts/task-management/enhanced-task-reference.js --auto

# Generate visualization only
node scripts/task-management/enhanced-task-reference.js --visualize-only

# Process a specific task
node scripts/task-management/enhanced-task-reference.js TS123
```

### 2. Git Hooks

The system includes three Git hooks:

#### Commit Message Hook

**File**: `scripts/task-management/commit-msg-hook.js`

Enforces task ID in commit messages with the format `[TASKID] commit message`. It provides suggestions based on files being committed and in-progress tasks.

#### Pre-Commit Hook

**File**: `scripts/task-management/pre-commit-hook.js`

Checks if files being committed have task references (`@task TASKID`). It warns about files missing references but allows bypassing the check if needed.

#### Post-Commit Hook

**File**: `scripts/task-management/post-commit-hook.js`

Updates the task-to-code relationship report after a commit.

**Setup**:
```bash
node scripts/task-management/setup-git-hooks.js
```

### 3. Task Metrics Dashboard

**File**: `scripts/task-management/task-metrics-dashboard.js`

Generates a metrics dashboard showing:
- Task completion progress
- Code coverage (files with task references)
- Task status distribution
- Traceability metrics
- Visualizations of task categories and priorities
- Recent activity

**Usage**:
```bash
node scripts/task-management/task-metrics-dashboard.js
```

### 4. JIRA Integration

**File**: `scripts/task-management/task-jira-sync.js`

Synchronizes tasks between the local task.md file and JIRA. It supports:
- Exporting tasks to JIRA (create/update JIRA issues)
- Importing tasks from JIRA (update task.md)
- Mapping task statuses, priorities, and fields between systems

**Usage**:
```bash
# Setup JIRA configuration
node scripts/task-management/task-jira-sync.js --setup

# Test JIRA connection
node scripts/task-management/task-jira-sync.js --test-connection

# Export tasks to JIRA
node scripts/task-management/task-jira-sync.js --export

# Import tasks from JIRA
node scripts/task-management/task-jira-sync.js --import
```

## Adding Task References to Files

Task references should be added to the top of each file in the following format:

### JavaScript/TypeScript Files
```javascript
/**
 * @task TS123 - Task title
 */
```

### Python Files
```python
"""
@task TS123 - Task title
"""
```

### Markdown/HTML Files
```html
<!--
@task TS123 - Task title
-->
```

### CSS/SCSS Files
```css
/*
 * @task TS123 - Task title
 */
```

The Enhanced Task Reference Manager can automatically add these references.

## Best Practices

1. **One Task, One Purpose**: Each task should have a clear, single responsibility.

2. **Task References in All Files**: Every non-configuration file should have at least one task reference.

3. **Meaningful Commit Messages**: All commits should reference the task ID they relate to.

4. **Regular Metrics Review**: Review the task metrics dashboard regularly to identify areas with low traceability.

5. **Update Task Status**: Keep task statuses updated in task.md as work progresses.

6. **Use the Tools**: Make use of the provided tools to maintain traceability instead of manual updates.

7. **JIRA Synchronization**: Regularly synchronize with JIRA to keep the task tracking systems aligned.

## Traceability Reports

The system generates several traceability reports:

1. **Task-to-Code Mapping**: `reports/task-management/task-code-mapping.md`
2. **Task Dependency Graph**: `reports/task-management/task-dependencies.dot` (and .png)
3. **Task Metrics Dashboard**: `reports/task-management/task-metrics-dashboard.html`
4. **Task Metrics JSON**: `reports/task-management/task-metrics.json`

These reports are automatically updated by the post-commit hook.

## Compliance and Auditing

The traceability system supports compliance requirements by:

1. **Requirement Traceability**: Mapping code to specific requirements (tasks).
2. **Bidirectional Traceability**: Supporting both forward and backward traceability.
3. **Automated Enforcement**: Ensuring consistent application of traceability practices.
4. **Evidence Generation**: Providing reports that can be used as evidence for audits.
5. **Version Control Integration**: Maintaining history of changes and relationships.

## Continuous Improvement

The traceability system should be continuously improved based on team feedback and project needs. Suggested improvements:

1. **IDE Integration**: Add plugins or extensions for common IDEs.
2. **Additional Visualizations**: Create more detailed visualizations of task relationships.
3. **Impact Analysis**: Add functionality to analyze the impact of changes to a task.
4. **Requirement-to-Task Mapping**: Add support for mapping requirements to tasks.
5. **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate traceability checks into CI/CD pipelines.
