# Authentication Improvements (TS009)

This document outlines the security enhancements implemented for the authentication system in 
AeroSuite.

## Overview

The authentication system has been enhanced with the following features:

1. __Improved Input Validation__
   - Comprehensive validation for registration, login, and password operations
   - Detailed password requirements with user-friendly error messages
   - Protection against common validation bypass techniques

2. __Advanced Security Monitoring__
   - Login attempt tracking and rate limiting
   - Account lockout protection after multiple failed attempts
   - Suspicious login detection based on location, device, and behavior

3. __Token Security Enhancements__
   - Improved JWT with fingerprinting to prevent token theft
   - Refresh token rotation with secure storage
   - Token versioning for forced invalidation when needed

4. __Two-Factor Authentication Improvements__
   - Enhanced MFA workflow with suspicious login detection
   - Forced MFA for suspicious login attempts
   - Improved MFA setup and verification processes

## Input Validation

Authentication requests now go through comprehensive validation to prevent common attack vectors:

- Email validation with normalization
- Password complexity validation with helpful error messages
- Protection against username enumeration
- Secure handling of verification tokens

## Security Monitoring

The system now tracks and analyzes login attempts to detect potentially malicious activity:

- Failed login attempts are tracked with rate limiting
- Accounts are automatically locked after 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes
- IP address and user agent information is stored for security analytics
- Suspicious login detection based on:
  - Geographic location changes
  - Device/browser changes
  - Unusual login times

## Token Security

JWT tokens have been enhanced with additional security features:

- Tokens include fingerprinting data (hashed IP and user agent)
- Refresh token rotation with secure HttpOnly cookies
- Tokens include version information for forced invalidation
- Short-lived tokens with secure refresh mechanism

## Two-Factor Authentication

The MFA system has been improved with:

- Support for app-based and email-based verification
- Forced MFA for suspicious login attempts
- Enhanced security notifications
- Improved MFA setup workflow
- User-friendly MFA verification UI

## Session Management

Users now have enhanced control over their sessions:

- Ability to view all active sessions
- Option to terminate specific sessions
- Force logout from all devices
- Session details including device, location, and last activity

## API Key Authentication

For machine-to-machine authentication, secure API keys are now supported:

- Time-limited API keys
- Scoped permissions for API keys
- Ability to revoke keys
- Usage tracking for API keys

## Security Events

All security-related events are now logged and available to users:

- Login attempts (successful and failed)
- Password changes
- MFA events
- Session creations and terminations
- Suspicious activity alerts

## Implementation Details

The implementation spans multiple components:

- `auth.validator.js`: Input validation middleware
- `security.service.js`: Security monitoring and threat detection
- `auth.middleware.js`: Enhanced token validation
- `auth.controller.js`: Improved authentication flows
- `auth.routes.js`: Updated API endpoints

## Future Improvements

Planned enhancements for future iterations:

1. WebAuthn/FIDO2 support for passwordless authentication
2. Risk-based authentication with adaptive challenges
3. Enhanced audit logging and security analytics
4. Integration with threat intelligence feeds
5. Advanced session management with context-aware access controls
