# Frontend Component Tests Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of frontend component tests (TS345) for the AeroSuite
application. These tests verify that the UI components render correctly and behave as expected when
users interact with them.

## Test Structure

The frontend component tests are organized by component and follow a consistent pattern:

1. __Rendering Tests__: Verify that components render correctly with different props
2. __Interaction Tests__: Verify that components respond correctly to user interactions
3. __Edge Case Tests__: Verify that components handle unusual situations correctly
4. __Style Tests__: Verify that components apply custom styles correctly

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack

- __Jest__: Test runner and assertion library
- __React Testing Library__: Component testing utilities
- __Mock Service Worker__: For mocking API requests (when needed)
- __jest-dom__: Custom DOM element matchers

### Key Files

- `client/src/__tests__/test-utils.tsx`: Common test utilities including provider wrappers
- `client/src/__tests__/components/`: Directory containing all component tests
  - `DataTable.test.tsx`: Tests for the data table component
  - `FormBuilder.test.tsx`: Tests for the form builder component
  - `Modal.test.tsx`: Tests for the modal dialog component
  - `Chart.test.tsx`: Tests for the data visualization component
  - `FiltersToolbar.test.tsx`: Tests for the filters toolbar component
  - `ErrorBoundary.test.tsx`: Tests for the error boundary component
  - `PageHeader.test.tsx`: Tests for the page header component
  - `LoadingButton.test.tsx`: Tests for the loading button component
  - `StatusBadge.test.tsx`: Tests for the status badge component

### Running Tests

The following npm scripts can be used to run the tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage

# Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --watch
```bash

## Test Patterns

### Component Testing Pattern

Each component test follows this general pattern:

1. __Setup__: Create test data and mock functions as needed
2. __Render__: Render the component with test data
3. __Assert__: Verify that the component renders and behaves correctly
4. __Interact__: Trigger user interactions (when applicable)
5. __Assert again__: Verify that the component responds correctly to interactions

### Test Utils

The `renderWithProviders` function in `test-utils.tsx` wraps components with the necessary
providers:

- Redux store provider
- Router provider
- Theme provider
- Notification provider

This ensures that components have access to all the context they need during testing.

## Coverage Areas

The tests cover these key functional areas:

1. __Data Display Components__:
   - Rendering data in tables and charts
   - Sorting, filtering, and pagination
   - Empty state handling
   - Loading state display

2. __Input Components__:
   - Form field validation
   - Submit and reset handling
   - Error message display
   - Default value handling

3. __Modal Dialogs__:
   - Opening and closing
   - Action button handling
   - Custom styling

4. __Filtering Components__:
   - Filter selection and application
   - Multiple filter types (text, select, date range, etc.)
   - Clearing filters

## Best Practices Implemented

1. __Accessibility Testing__: Components are tested for accessibility attributes
2. __User-Centric Testing__: Tests focus on user interactions rather than implementation details
3. __Isolation__: Components are tested in isolation from external dependencies
4. __Comprehensive Coverage__: Multiple test cases cover various aspects of each component
5. __Mock Testing__: External dependencies are mocked to ensure consistent test results

## Future Improvements

1. __Visual Regression Testing__: Add visual regression tests for UI components
2. __Test Coverage Reporting__: Implement test coverage reporting and set coverage thresholds
3. __End-to-End Testing__: Expand testing to include end-to-end user workflows
4. __Performance Testing__: Add tests to verify component performance
5. __Browser Compatibility Testing__: Test components across different browsers
