# API Integration Tests Documentation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of API integration tests (TS344) for the AeroSuite 
application. These tests verify that the API endpoints work correctly and that the different 
components of the system integrate properly.

## Test Structure

The integration tests are organized by API resource and follow a consistent pattern:

1. __Setup__: Each test suite uses a setup module that provides:
   - In-memory MongoDB database for testing
   - Test data generation
   - Authentication utilities
   - Request helper based on Supertest

2. __Test Categories__: Tests are organized by HTTP method and endpoint path
   - GET endpoints (list, detail, filtering)
   - POST endpoints (creation)
   - PUT endpoints (updates)
   - DELETE endpoints (deletion)
   - Special operations (e.g., complete inspection)

3. __Test Coverage__: Each endpoint is tested for:
   - Successful operations
   - Error conditions
   - Authentication requirements
   - Input validation

## Implementation Details

### Technology Stack

- __Jest__: Test runner and assertion library
- __Supertest__: HTTP assertion library
- __mongodb-memory-server__: In-memory MongoDB server for isolated testing

### Key Files

- `server/src/__tests__/integration/setup.js`: Common setup and utilities for all tests
- `server/src/__tests__/integration/auth.test.js`: Authentication API tests
- `server/src/__tests__/integration/customers.test.js`: Customer management API tests
- `server/src/__tests__/integration/suppliers.test.js`: Supplier management API tests
- `server/src/__tests__/integration/inspections.test.js`: Inspection workflow API tests

### Running Tests

The following npm scripts have been added to run the tests:

```bash
# Run only integration tests
npm run test:integration

# Run only unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run all tests
npm test
```bash

## Test Data Generation

The tests use a test data generator that:

1. Creates realistic test data for all entity types
2. Maintains proper relationships between entities
3. Allows customization of generated data
4. Supports seeding for reproducible results

## Authentication Strategy

For authenticated endpoints, the tests:

1. Create a test user with admin privileges
2. Authenticate to obtain a JWT token
3. Include the token in subsequent requests
4. Test both authenticated and unauthenticated scenarios

## Benefits

- __Isolated Testing__: Each test runs in isolation with its own database
- __Fast Execution__: In-memory database provides fast test execution
- __Complete Coverage__: All API endpoints and operations are tested
- __Realistic Data__: Tests use realistic data with proper relationships
- __Error Handling__: Tests verify proper error responses and status codes

## Future Improvements

1. Add performance benchmarks for critical API operations
2. Implement test coverage reporting
3. Add data-driven tests for edge cases
4. Integrate with CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
5. Add load testing scenarios for API endpoints
