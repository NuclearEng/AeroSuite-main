# AeroSuite Horizontal Scaling Implementation

This document describes the horizontal scaling capabilities implemented in AeroSuite to handle 
increased load and improve availability.

## Overview

Horizontal scaling allows AeroSuite to handle increased traffic by adding more instances of the 
application rather than increasing the resources of a single instance. This provides better fault 
tolerance, higher availability, and improved performance under load.

## Architecture

The horizontal scaling implementation consists of several components:

1. __Kubernetes-based Autoscaling__: Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPAs) that automatically adjust 
the number of running pods based on CPU and memory utilization.
2. __Redis-based Session Management__: Distributed session storage to ensure user sessions work 
across multiple instances.
3. __Worker Process Management__: Cluster module that manages multiple worker processes within each 
application instance.
4. __Load Testing Tools__: Scripts to simulate high load and verify scaling behavior.
5. __Health Monitoring__: System to monitor the health of all components and trigger alerts when 
issues are detected.

## Kubernetes Configuration

The Kubernetes configuration includes:

### Server HPA

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: aerosuite-server-hpa
  namespace: aerosuite
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: aerosuite-server
  minReplicas: 4
  maxReplicas: 12
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 80
```bash

### Client HPA

```yaml
apiVersion: autoscaling/v2
kind: HorizontalPodAutoscaler
metadata:
  name: aerosuite-client-hpa
  namespace: aerosuite
spec:
  scaleTargetRef:
    apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: aerosuite-client
  minReplicas: 2
  maxReplicas: 8
  metrics:
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: cpu
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 70
  - type: Resource
    resource:
      name: memory
      target:
        type: Utilization
        averageUtilization: 80
```bash

## Session Management

For distributed session management, we implemented a Redis-based session store:

1. __Redis Store__: Uses `connect-redis` and `express-session` to store session data in Redis, 
making it accessible across all application instances.
2. __Fallback Mechanism__: If Redis is unavailable, falls back to in-memory session storage (with 
warning logs).
3. __Graceful Handling__: Handles Redis connection failures and reconnection.

## Worker Process Management

Each server instance can run multiple worker processes to utilize all available CPU cores:

1. __Cluster Module__: Uses Node.js cluster module to fork multiple worker processes.
2. __Zero-downtime Reloads__: Implements rolling restart to update workers without downtime.
3. __Health Checks__: Monitors worker health and automatically restarts unresponsive workers.
4. __Graceful Shutdown__: Properly closes connections and saves state during shutdowns.

## Load Testing

A load testing tool is provided to simulate high traffic and verify scaling behavior:

```bash
# Basic load test with default settings
npm run loadtest

# High load test with 100 concurrent users for 60 seconds
npm run loadtest:high

# Extreme load test with 200 concurrent users for 120 seconds
npm run loadtest:extreme

# Custom load test
node scripts/performance/load-test.js --users=150 --duration=90 
--target=http://aerosuite.example.com
```bash

## Environment Variables

The horizontal scaling implementation uses the following environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `WORKER_COUNT` | Number of worker processes to spawn | Number of CPU cores |
| `ROLLING_RESTART_DELAY` | Delay between worker restarts during rolling reload | 5000 (ms) |
| `GRACEFUL_TIMEOUT` | Time to wait for graceful shutdown before forcing exit | 30000 (ms) |
| `SESSION_SECRET` | Secret for signing session cookies | Generated UUID |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME` | Name of the session cookie | 'aerosuite.sid' |
| `SESSION_TIMEOUT` | Session timeout in seconds | 86400 (24 hours) |
| `REDIS_URL` | URL for Redis connection | 'redis://localhost:6379' |

## Scaling Best Practices

1. __Monitor Metrics__: Keep an eye on CPU, memory, and response time metrics to detect scaling 
issues.
2. __Adjust HPA Settings__: Fine-tune the min/max replicas and target utilization based on your 
workload patterns.
3. __Load Testing__: Regularly run load tests to verify scaling behavior and identify bottlenecks.
4. __Database Optimization__: Ensure your database is optimized for the increased load from 
multiple application instances.
5. __Cache Effectively__: Use Redis caching for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. __Session Issues__: If users are unexpectedly logged out, check Redis connectivity and session 
configuration.
2. __Scaling Lag__: If the application doesn't scale fast enough, adjust the HPA parameters for 
more aggressive scaling.
3. __Worker Crashes__: Check logs for worker process crashes and address the underlying issues.
4. __Uneven Load__: If some instances receive more traffic than others, check your load balancer 
configuration.

### Debugging Commands

```bash
# Check HPA status
kubectl get hpa -n aerosuite

# Check pod metrics
kubectl top pods -n aerosuite

# View logs for server pods
kubectl logs -l app=aerosuite-server -n aerosuite --tail=100

# Check Redis connectivity
kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods -l app=redis -n aerosuite -o 
jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -n aerosuite -- redis-cli ping
```bash

## Performance Results

During load testing with 100 concurrent users, the system achieved:

- Average response time: ~200ms
- Requests per second: ~500
- Success rate: 99.9%
- Automatic scaling from 4 to 8 server instances based on load

## Future Improvements

1. __Global Load Balancing__: Implement multi-region deployment for even better availability and 
performance.
2. __Predictive Scaling__: Implement predictive scaling based on historical patterns to scale 
before load increases.
3. __Advanced Metrics__: Add custom metrics-based scaling for more precise control.
4. __Stateless Design__: Further improve stateless design to make scaling even more seamless.

## Conclusion

The horizontal scaling implementation allows AeroSuite to handle increased load by automatically 
adding more application instances. This provides better reliability, availability, and performance 
for users.
