🛠 Example Implementation Path

Step-by-step integration for AI/ML-based defect detection:

AI001 → Computer vision defect detection core
AI002 → YOLOv8 for inference
AI003 → Training infra + evaluation
AI021 → GD&T symbol recognition
AI022 → Dimensional accuracy validation (✅ Completed)
AI025 → FedRAMP compliance audit
AI023/AI024 → Testing and A/B experimentation
📦 Upcoming Refactors (Suggestions)

Consolidate repeated "Services Services" and "Models Models" task names
Refactor test entries into a matrix of coverage status
Visualize dependencies via a task graph
Introduce tags: and owner: metadata for filtering and accountability
